0,1-2-Switch,/wiki/1-2-Switch,Party,Nintendo EPD,Nintendo,"March 3, 2017","March 3, 2017","March 3, 2017"," 1-2-Switch is a party game in which players do not usually rely on what is happening on a screen, but rather make use of audio cues and the functionality of the Switch's Joy-Con controllers to play in several different games. It features 28 different minigames, most of which involve two players, who each use one of the Joy-Con controllers and are often encouraged to look at each other during gameplay. Aside from tutorial videos for each game, players mostly rely solely on audio cues and feedback from the Joy-Con's rumble feature to indicate how well they are playing each game.  "
1,140,/wiki/140_(video_game),Action,Carlsen Games,Carlsen Games,Unreleased,"January 9, 2020","January 9, 2020"," As described by Carlsen, 140 is “an old school platformer”, but where the challenge is “in syncing up your moves and jumps to the music-controlled elements”; as the player progresses through a level, the music will change to reflect the difficulty of the platforming elements. The player controls a geometric shape—a square when stationary, a circle when moving, and a triangle when jumping—across a two-dimensional environment made up of other simple geometric shapes, with the objective being to reach the end of the course. Along the way the player will need to collect floating colored balls that, when placed in a semicircular fixture on the ground, activate a new type of platforming obstacle that allows the player to continue. These activations also have the effects of changing the color palette of the level and adding a new element to the music to which the new obstacle is synchronized.  Various obstacles and enemies, represented by geometric shapes, test the player's skills, and should the shape fall or be hit by one of the shapes filled with white noise, they will need to restart at the last checkpoint they passed. All of these obstacles and enemies have actions that are synchronized to the music, aiding the player in moving through the course; platforms that move or appear and disappear will do so on the beat, while enemies will fire in time to the music.

Set in the 1980s, the game follows the ""Kid"", the teenager from the introduction, who feels stuck in his childhood home in ""sleepy suburbia"" as he waits for his life to ""move forward"". One night, as ""the Kid"" wanders the streets of his unnamed city looking for anything to ""make his heart skip a beat again"", he stumbles onto an abandoned factory that was built ""long before"" the protagonist was born and now houses an arcade. Wondering if he found a place where he can fit in, he starts playing a horizontally scrolling space shooter entitled Out of the Void. Feeling disconnected at school, the Kid's mind frequently returns to the arcade where he was ""on an asteroid somewhere fighting space invaders."" The only person he notices in school is ""her"" a ""punk rocker from the south district"" who's freedom the Kid admires. 198X then cuts to the KId playing an arcade racing game entitled The Runaway. During The Runaway's second stage, the Kid explains that he's started to spend every night at the arcade, where every game he mastered made him ""stronger"" and ""more confident"". One evening, the Kid reminisces about his childhood and how ""anything was possible"" back then before ""everyone got brainwashed"" in high school. He then mentions how when your a kid ""shadows seem darker and more terrifying"" yet ""more exciting"" at the same time. The game then transitions to a ninja video game called Shadowplay. That night, while walking to the arcade, the Kid reveals that his parents split up due to an incident involving the Kid's father. He also mentions that night was when ""everything changed"" at the arcade before 198X transitions into a role-playing video game entitled Kill Screen where the player has to defeat 3 dragons in order to solve a maze before fighting the unwinnable SHODAN-like final boss. Afterwards the Kid is seen sitting outside the arcade in the rain mentioning that he ""was still there"" but that ""nothing was the same"". Characters from 198Xs various games begin to materialize around him, with the protagonist concluding that the ""game was not over"".  "

The twist is that these stages are generated randomly based on level segments, or ""chunks"", and also allow for both local and online co-op. Rather than giving you several lives, the game has permadeath, but is a ""roguelite"" in that you can use Soul Chips earned during the level to unlock new types of passive upgrades to buy, and gain upgrades for the next attempt of that particular run.  During levels players can use bolts gained as currency to buy passive upgrades, or to gain back health or energy in vending machines. They can also find upgrades in treasure chests and other places. Upon beating a boss the player can choose to take their power as a reward, granting them a new special ability, or take a reward of bolts or a random passive upgrade instead.   The game follows Nina, an armored girl armed with a power blaster, and Ace, an armored boy who has an energy sword, in the aftermath of a robotic uprising.  Traveling from their base on the Ark, a space station orbiting the Earth, they have been hired to clear dangerous locations that are infested with robots that have run amok.  "

Every level is grouped into a certain ""world"" each of which is based on a planet (it also includes the Sun), with each world having a different thematic mechanic.   The Moon prepares to set and allow the Sun to rise, however, the Moon notices the Sun is missing. The Moon then begins a journey to find the Sun, and tell him to come back to Earth. On the way, the Moon talks to each of the planets, who give their opinions or advice on the situation. At the end, the Sun tells the Moon that he never left, and the Moon begins the journey back.  "
7,7 Billion Humans,/wiki/7_Billion_Humans,Puzzle,Tomorrow Corporation,Tomorrow Corporation,"October 25, 2018","October 25, 2018","October 25, 2018"," Similar to Human Resource Machine, players are tasked with over 60 programming puzzles, typically involving the movement of numerical data cubes by human workers. For example, a task might ask the player to program the humans to sort the numbers on data cubes in order. The programming language is similar to assembly language, allowing for simple loops, logic, memory storage and calculations.    The same program is used to control all humans simultaneously, while allowing each human to follow its individual logic through the project based on their current state, such as moving left or right based on comparing the value of the data cube they are holding. The humans will run through the program until either the program solution is met, or all the humans reach the end of the program and the problem solution is not met, in which case the player must rework the program. The player is able to step through the program and select any individual human to watch their progress through the program for debugging purposes.   Once a player achieves a working solution for a given problem, the game will then simulate 25 additional cases where random factors (such as values of data cubes) change, which might cause a program to fail and require the player to account for that. Otherwise, the player is then ranked on the number of program steps they have, and the number of seconds (cycles) it takes for the program to complete, measured against average marks determined by Tomorrow Corporation. Most levels provide two optional challenges, to beat the average steps and average seconds with optimization of their program; these are sometimes diametric goals and do not need to be completed within the same program. Other puzzles are fully optional, requiring more advanced techniques to solve.  "

It features cooperative and competitive game modes, for up to four players, which can be played either locally or online.

10,Aaero,/wiki/Aaero,Action,Mad Fellows,JP,"December 27, 2018","December 24, 2018","December 24, 2018"," The basic controls are that of a twin-stick shooter, the left stick controlling the ship while the right controls targeting.  Mike Fahey of Kotaku says: ""Aaero sees players navigating through alien environments in a futuristic flying craft. As the music plays, ribbons of light bend and twist in the air, visualizing aspects of the song. Sometimes it’s vocals. Sometimes it’s strange electronic wails. Using the left analog stick (required even in the PC version), players must grind against those ribbons in order to absorb the energy of the music.""   He goes on to describe the shooting element of the gameplay: ""The game’s tunnel-like environments warp and twist to impede the player, each new level bringing unique obstacles and traps into play. Odd mechanical enemies attack from time to time, with the game employing a target lock and fire mechanic using a combination of right analog and trigger.""   In his review for Forbes, Mitch Wallace describes the gameplay: ""The general on-rail, twin-stick shooting setup is deceptively simple: Pilot a nondescript spaceship through various alien and possibly post-apocalyptic stages, gunning down enemies and tracing ribbons of light as you go.""

The diver's course through the game follows a linear path through interconnected areas filled with marine life. The player directs the diver through the environments using full analogue control, able to interact with the environment to solve switch or item-based puzzles, and sit on pedestals within each area to observe the surrounding sea life.

15,Afterparty,/wiki/Afterparty_(video_game),Adventure,Night School Studio,Night School Studio,Unreleased,"March 6, 2020","March 6, 2020"," Lifelong friends and recent college graduates Sang Bong or as he prefers Milo, and Lola Woolfe find themselves in Hell, with no recollection of how they came to be there. After being assigned a Personal Demon, Sister Mary Wormhorn, they meet Sam, a psychopomp cab driver. Sam explains that while demons torture humans, after work hours, both groups enjoy the nights drinking and partying. Sam explains that the only way out of Hell is to outdrink and out-party Satan himself in a contest. Needing an invite to Satan's party at his home, Milo and Lola traverse Hell. Milo and Lola eventually meet Lucifer, who demands they prove their abilities before challenging him by obtaining seals of approval from his brothers and sisters, the Monarchs of Hell.  One of the Monarchs is Apollyon, a judge of the Dead. Milo and Lola sneak into a demons-only bar to find Apollyon, who sees through their disguise and agrees to give them a seal if they serve as lawyers for Roberto, a soul charged with serial murder. Milo and Lola can either throw the trial per Apollyon's wishes or else let Roberto ascend to heaven and challenge Apollyon afterward; either way, Apollyon will give the pair her seal.  Another Monarch is the hard-partying Asmodeus, who is trying to forget about his recent breakup with his ex, Beth. Milo and Lola can either get Asmodeus and Beth back together or otherwise beat Asmodeus in a dance-off, to obtain the necessary seal.  Having obtained the needed seals, Milo and Lola return to Satan's party, with a team of challengers drawn from the people they have met during the night. Apollyon attempts an intervention, feeling that Satan's drinking is out of control and Hell is suffering because of it, but Satan angrily continues the drinking game with Milo and Lola, teleporting them away from the party.  The game has multiple endings, depending on Milo and Lola's performance. If they win the contest, they are sent back to Earth and resume their lives. If they lose the contest or refuse to play, they remain in Hell; while Satan still struggles with his addiction, Hell appears to be running better. After mentioning that Hell is actually better than they thought, Sam bursts in, having found another loophole to possibly allow them to escape Hell, to which Milo and Lola immediately agree to.  "
17,Agony,/wiki/Agony_(2018_video_game),Survival horror,Madmind Studio,Forever Entertainment,Unreleased,"October 31, 2019","October 31, 2019"," The game is played from a first-person perspective. The player controls one of the Martyrs condemned to Hell, Amraphel (aka Nimrod) tasked with meeting the Red Goddess, one of the creators of Hell, in an effort to escape and return to the land of the living. Unlike other Martyrs, the player possesses the unique ability to possess both other Martyrs and, later in the game, lesser and higher demons, giving them access to special abilities. Using mechanics such as crouching and holding their breath, the player can avoid demons. Besides hiding, the player needs to solve puzzles in order to unlock new areas. There are available hidden statues that the player can collect, as well as paintings which are possible to discover.   The story follows a lost soul trapped in Hell without any memory of his former life. From what is revealed of the protagonist's backstory, he was a king of an ancient land who made a Faustian bargain with the Red Goddess. In-story, he is referred to as both Nimrod by the Goddess and Amraphel by other condemned souls, some of whom still have their memories, blaming the protagonist for them being damned to Hell because of the acts he committed while alive. As the protagonist wanders through the wastelands of Hell, he discovers a possibility of escaping through the aid of the Red Goddess. Determined, he travels to the Red Goddess' lair to learn how he can be set free.  If the player obeys the Red Goddess's commands, they will ultimately venture to the lowest depths of Hell, provoking a creature known only as the Beast. Sufficiently wearing down the Beast, the protagonist is able to possess it, using its power to break the seals binding it to the lower depths. Satisfied, the Red Goddess reveals herself as the Whore of Babylon and vows to use the Beast to begin the Apocalypse. The protagonist is returned to the living world, per his deal, only to be killed by the Beast moments later as the Red Goddess begins her conquest of Earth, leaving the player's soul to return to Hell.  The story features multiple other endings, dependent on how the player progresses and the choices they make. However, only two of these are canonical.  "
21,Alien Isolation,/wiki/Alien_Isolation,Survival horror,Creative Assembly,Sega,"December 5, 2019","December 5, 2019","December 5, 2019"," Alien: Isolation is a single-player action-adventure game with emphasis on stealth and survival horror features. The player controls Amanda Ripley from a first-person perspective, and must explore a space station and complete objectives while avoiding, outsmarting and defeating enemies. Objectives range from activating computers to collecting certain items or reaching a specific area in the game. The player can run, climb ladders, sneak into vents, crouch behind objects to break the line of sight with enemies, and peek over or lean around to gain view. The player also has the ability to go under tables or inside lockers to hide from enemies.  Amanda encounters several antagonists over the course of the game, including hostile humans and androids. These can be defeated with gunplay or other offensive means. The main antagonist, an Alien creature, pursues the player throughout the game. The Alien creature cannot be defeated, requiring the player to use stealth tactics in order to survive. Instead of following a predetermined path, the Alien has the ability to actively investigate disturbances and hunt the player by sight or sound. Along the way, the player can use both a flashlight and a motion tracker to detect the Alien's movements. However, using any of these increases the chance of the Alien finding the player. For example, if the Alien is moving and close enough, the tracker's sound will attract the Alien, forcing the player to use the tracker wisely and remove it as soon as it detects motion. The motion tracker cannot detect enemies when they are not moving and cannot determine if the alien creature is up in the ducts or on ground level.  Although Amanda gains access to a revolver, a shotgun, a bolt gun, a flamethrower, and a stun baton over the course of the game, Alien: Isolation emphasises evasion over direct combat by providing limited ammunition. The player can also craft items by collecting schematics and different materials. Items include EMP, noisemakers, molotov cocktails, and pipe bombs; these can help the player deal with enemies. For example, the noisemaker can be used to attract enemies in a particular direction. The Alien is afraid of fire, so using flame weapons forces it to retreat into the station's ventilation system. The player has a limited amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies; health is restored with medkits, which can be crafted with materials in Amanda's inventory.  The space station is divided into sections connected by trams and elevators. Some doors require certain actions before entry is allowed; for example, some require a keycard or entry codes, while others need to be hacked, or to be cut with welding torches. Computer terminals and rewiring stations can be used to access information, trigger actions such as disabling security cameras or manipulating the space station's air-purification mechanism. An automap helps the player navigate the different areas of the game. To save game progress, the player needs to locate a terminal in the game and insert Amanda's access card. If Amanda dies, the player will have to restart from the last saved point. In addition to the campaign mode, Alien: Isolation features a special mode, called Survivor Mode, in which the player must complete objectives within a time limit on different challenge maps, while avoiding an alien creature.   In 2137, 15 years after the events of the original Alien film, Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen Ripley, learns that the flight recorder of her mother's ship, the Nostromo, has been located. The flight recorder was retrieved by salvage ship Anesidora, and is being held aboard Sevastopol, a Seegson Corporation space station orbiting gas giant KG-348. Christopher Samuels, a Weyland-Yutani android, offers Ripley a place on the retrieval team so that she can have closure regarding the fate of her missing mother.   Ripley, Samuels, and Weyland-Yutani executive Nina Taylor travel to Sevastopol via the Torrens, a courier ship, finding that the station is damaged and communications are offline. They attempt to spacewalk into Sevastopol, but their EVA line is severed by debris, separating Ripley from the others. While exploring the station, Ripley finds the flight recorder of the Nostromo, but the data has been corrupted. She also discovers that the station is out of control due to a single, deadly Alien creature lurking aboard. After regrouping with Samuels and Taylor, Ripley meets the station's Marshal, Waits, and his deputy, Ricardo. Waits explains that the alien was brought onto the station by Anesidora captain Henry Marlow. After recovering the Nostromo's flight recorder while salvaging its remains in space, the crew was able to backtrack the Nostromo's path to LV-426 and locate the derelict ship, containing within a nest of alien eggs. Marlow's wife was attacked by a Facehugger, and was then brought aboard Sevastopol for emergency medical treatment, but died after a Chestburster hatched from her. Waits convinces Ripley to contain the Alien inside a remote module of the station, and then eject it into space. Although Ripley is successful, Waits ejects the module with her still inside. Careening into KG-348, Ripley space-jumps back to Sevastopol using a space suit.  Ripley makes her way back to confront Waits, but Ricardo reveals that the station's service androids abruptly started slaughtering the remaining crew, including Waits. Samuels attempts to interface with the station's artificial intelligence, APOLLO, to cease the rampage. However, the systems's defensive countermeasures kill him shortly after he opens a path for Ripley into APOLLO's control core. There, Ripley discovers that Seegson had been trying to sell off Sevastopol to Weyland-Yutani, who instructed APOLLO to protect the alien at all costs. Ripley tells APOLLO that the creature is no longer aboard the station and demands to cease all activity, but the system refuses, stating that ""scheduled reactor scans are unverified"". At the reactor, Ripley discovers a nest with hundreds of Aliens, and initiates a reactor purge to destroy it.   Ripley learns that Taylor was secretly sent to retrieve the Alien from Sevastopol, and that she freed Marlow in exchange for the location of LV-426. However, Marlow double-crossed her and took her hostage aboard the Anesidora. There, Ripley finally discovers the Nostromo's flight recorder, containing Ellen Ripley's monologue from the end of Alien. Meanwhile, Marlow attempts to overload the fusion reactor of the Anesidora to destroy Sevastopol and ensure that no alien creatures survive; Taylor kills him in an attempt to stop him, but she herself is killed by electric discharge, forcing Ripley to escape shortly before the Anesidora explodes. The explosion destroys Sevastopol's orbital stabilisers, causing the station to slowly drift into KG-348's atmosphere. Ripley and Ricardo contact the Torrens for extraction, but a facehugger latches on to Ricardo, forcing Ripley to leave him. After making her way outside to help the Torrens detach from the station, Ripley is surrounded by Alien creatures and ultimately thrown into the ship by a blast. Aboard the Torrens, Ripley discovers that another Alien has boarded the ship. When Ripley is cornered in the airlock, she ejects herself and the Alien into space. Adrift in her space suit, Ripley is awakened by a searchlight.  "
22,The Alliance Alive HD Remastered,/wiki/The_Alliance_Alive_HD_Remastered,Role-playing,Cattle Call,JP,"October 10, 2019","October 8, 2019","October 11, 2019"," The Alliance Alive is a role-playing video game in which the player takes control of a group eventually numbering nine characters, navigating an unnamed fantasy world in a quest to free it from the control of otherworldly beings called Daemons. Players explore a world map, first on foot and later using vehicles which can unlock previously inaccessible parts of the map. During the course of the story, the party unites human-staffed Guilds scattered across the land, based in Guild Towers which are either found on the world map or can be built by the player in select locations. There are five types of Guild Towers available, which grant different status buffs to the party, with the type of Guild Tower available to build depending on which characters have been recruited into the party. Guild Towers can communicate with each other during the course of the game using the Telegraph system, which allows Towers to gain experience levels and unlock new abilities.  Enemy characters are represented within environments and on the world map as symbols, with battles triggering when the party runs into them. Multiple enemy parties can be tagged for a series of back-to-back battles. Battles are governed by a turn-based battle system within a themed battle arena. Characters are arranged in formations on a three-by-five grid, with different formations granting unique defensive and offensive abilities. Magic is only accessible to Daemon characters, although certain weapon types can access magic-like abilities for human characters such as healing. During combat, characters can enter an ""Ignition"" state once the Ignition gauge is filled from being attacked. Entering an Ignition state, which can rise in intensity based on current skills, attack power is increased at the cost of higher skill point consumption for special abilities. When in an Ignition state, a character can launch a special ""Final Strike"" attack which deals high damage. If a character in the same class as the attacker is next to them, they will ""Reinforce"" the Final Strike, creating a longer attack chain.  Rather than a traditional experience point-based leveling system, character skills grow more powerful through ""Awakening"" when used often enough. Completing successive battles will increase a skill's growth. Characters have access to five weapon types with differing strengths and weaknesses: Swords, Great Swords, Axes, Spears, Staffs, Bows, Shields, and Martial Arts. These weapon types can be equipped to any character, and have specific Awakening skills tied to them. Triggering a battle near a Guild Tower enables Telegraph abilities which aid the party in battle, such as creating a shield or dealing a powerful attack to all enemies at the beginning of a battle. A separate ""Talent"" system can be raised for each character using Talent Points earned after each battle. Assigning these points to Talents will increase a character attribute such as their ability to regain health or energy, their weapon skills, and status buffs during navigation of the world map.  "
24,Amnesia Collection,/wiki/Amnesia_Collection,Survival horror,Frictional Games,Frictional Games,Unreleased,"September 12, 2019","September 12, 2019"," Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a first-person adventure game with survival horror elements. The player takes control of Daniel, who must navigate Brennenburg Castle while avoiding various dangers and solving puzzles. The gameplay retains the physical object interaction used in the Penumbra series, allowing for physics-based puzzles and interactions such as opening doors and fixing machinery. Smaller items can be stored in an inventory menu, while larger objects can be raised by holding down a mouse button and pushing or pulling the mouse. Objects such as doors or levers can be manipulated by using the mouse in a fashion that imitates moving the said object. The game's difficulty level can be adjusted preceding its initiation, but cannot be readjusted once the game has begun.  In addition to a health indicator, Daniel's sanity must be managed, centered around an ""afraid of darkness"" mechanic. According to designer Thomas Grip, ""the idea was basically that the darkness itself should be an enemy."" Sanity is reduced by staying in the dark for too long, witnessing unsettling events or looking directly at monsters. Low sanity causes visual and auditory hallucinations and an increased chance of attracting monsters, while its complete depletion results in a temporary drop in mobility, or death in higher difficulties. Light sources help restore sanity, and if none are available, Daniel may use tinderboxes to ignite candles and torches or deploy an oil-burning lantern. However, the number of tinderboxes and the amount of oil available are both limited, even more so in higher difficulties.  If a monster sees Daniel, it will chase him until he evades its sight. Daniel has no means of fighting monsters, so he must either avoid being seen or run away. Daniel can withstand only a few attacks from a monster before he dies, which will cause the most recent save of the game to load. The player can restore Daniel's health by using laudanum found throughout the game. The player can hinder monsters by closing doors and building barricades from nearby objects. However, monsters can destroy doors and knock over objects. Hiding in dark areas where monsters will not notice Daniel is also effective, but will decrease Daniel's sanity. In higher difficulties, the monsters will move faster, deal more damage and search for Daniel for longer periods of time.   In August 1839, Daniel, a young man from London, awakens in the dark and empty halls of the Prussian Brennenburg Castle with  no memory about himself or his past. All he can remember is his name, that he lives in Mayfair, and that something or someone is hunting him. Shortly after regaining consciousness, Daniel finds a note written to himself, which informs him that he has deliberately erased his own memory and is being hunted by a ""Shadow"", an unearthly presence that manifests itself through fleshy, acidic growths spreading throughout the castle. The note instructs Daniel to descend into the Inner Sanctum of the castle in order to find and kill its baron, Alexander.  As he makes his way through the castle, Daniel gradually learns both about its mysteries and about his own past, through notes and diaries he finds as well as through sudden flashbacks and visions. The origin of his situation is a mysterious orb that he recovered from the Tin Hinan Tomb, which unleashed the Shadow. Each of the experts he contacted and consulted about the orb later suffered horrible deaths. Daniel desperately turned to Alexander, who promised a means of repelling the threat of the Shadow. However, Alexander's true purpose is to return to his native dimension, from which he was banished. To achieve this end, Alexander and Daniel gathered ""vitae"" energy by torturing innocent people that Alexander claimed to be criminals. After Alexander left Daniel for dead following the final ritual, Daniel lost faith in Alexander and decided to exact vengeance.  As Daniel nears the Inner Sanctum, he encounters Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, a man who had once studied the orbs with his student Johann Weyer and has since been kept alive and imprisoned by Alexander. He tells Daniel that Weyer has been able to harness the power of the orbs to travel between dimensions, and instructs him in finding the pieces of what used to be his own orb, which is needed to breach the Inner Sanctum. Agrippa also asks Daniel to take with him his head, which can be severed alive using a tonic invented by Weyer, and throw it into the inter-dimensional portal after Alexander opens it. Once Daniel enters the Inner Sanctum, there are three possible endings: he can let Alexander succeed, then be killed by the Shadow and descend into darkness, while Alexander tells him his sacrifice will be forever celebrated; he can prevent the portal from opening, then leave the castle content with his redemption after the Shadow kills only Alexander; or he can throw Agrippa's head into the portal, which leaves the Shadow to kill both Alexander and Daniel, though Agrippa promises to save Daniel from descending into darkness, calling upon Weyer to help him.

28,Animal Crossing New Horizons,/wiki/Animal_Crossing_New_Horizons,Simulation,Nintendo EPD,Nintendo,"March 20, 2020","March 20, 2020","March 20, 2020"," As in previous installments in the Animal Crossing series, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a nonlinear life simulation game played in real-time. The player assumes the role of a customizable character who moves to a deserted island after purchasing a deserted island package from Tom Nook, a tanuki character who is a staple of the series. The game proceeds in an open-ended fashion as the player explores the island, and develops it into a community of anthropomorphic animals. Players can collect different items to use as decorations within the game. Like in the 2017 spin-off title Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp for mobile devices, the game introduces a crafting system that allows the player to convert materials into tools and furniture, which can be used to decorate the game's interior and exterior spaces.  The game allows the player to customize the appearance of their character at will, and does not lock specific hairstyles or facial features to specific genders. Players are additionally able to select their character's skin color, a feature introduced in the 2015 spin-off title Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer. Nook Miles, an in-game currency earned by completing various tasks, can be used to purchase premium items. Players are able to invite animals to live on their island, and have the option to choose or influence where the animal constructs their home. The game's weather adjusts to the seasons of the Northern or Southern Hemisphere, depending on the player's real-world location, a first for the Animal Crossing series. Another first is the addition of windy weather, which is expressed in the movement of the leaves on the trees.  Once the player has made sufficient progress in New Horizons, Isabelle appears in the game. Additionally, Mr. Resetti no longer lectures the player about saving (due to the autosave function and the removal of the ability to reset); instead, it is heavily implied that he is the operator for the Rescue Service.  The game supports one island per Switch system. Animal Crossing: New Horizons supports both local and online co-op gameplay, with up to four players locally and eight players online able to occupy an island at any given time. The game does not connect directly with Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, though there are collaboration items between the two games. The game does support amiibo cards and figures from the Animal Crossing series, but does not support Nintendo Switch Online cloud saves, though the ability for Nintendo Switch Online users to recover game data if their Switch is lost, broken, or stolen will be added ""sometime in the future"".

A similar event is expected to take place in 2038, so a supercomputer called Gaia is used to create an alternate Earth using an Earth Simulator in order to study the possible effects of the impending catastrophe. The experiment was initially inconclusive because of the possibility of low birth rates in the alternate Earth, so a message called the Arecibo Message was used to allow humans to live there. However, humanity in the alternate Earth then create their own Earth Simulator leads to questions about the original Earth's existence. The game takes place in 2037.

In the initial part of the game, the player's character Lester is unarmed. He is able to kick at small creatures, but is otherwise defenseless.  Later in the game, the player acquires a laser pistol from a fallen foe. The pistol has three capabilities: a standard fire mode, the ability to create force fields to block enemy fire, and a powerful charged shot that can break through force fields and some walls. Enemies also have the same capabilities, requiring the player to take advantage of the three gun modes and the environment to overcome them.  Lester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and the game ends immediately if either of them is struck by a projectile or comes in contact with an animal or an environmental hazard. However, the game uses numerous checkpoints enabling the player to keep restarting at the last point indefinitely. On the Amiga and older consoles without the ability to save a game, the player can write down an alphanumeric code for these checkpoints and re-enter it when restarting the game later. In any given scene, the game provides no clues as to what the player should do next, features no HUD except for an oxygen bar during the swimming sequences, and no on-screen text; and the characters the player meets speak in an unintelligible alien language.   The protagonist of the game is Lester Knight Chaykin, a young genius physicist. In the opening cinematic, Lester arrives at his high-tech underground laboratory in his Ferrari 288 GTO during a thunderstorm and goes to work on his experiment using a particle accelerator, attempting to reconstruct what happened when the universe was born. Immediately before the particles reach their intended destination, a lightning bolt strikes the laboratory and interferes with the accelerator, causing an unforeseen particle fusion and an explosion, opening a hole in time and space and teleporting Lester to a barren, alien planet.  After evading a number of dangerous indigenous animals, Lester is captured by a race of humanoid aliens and taken to a subterranean prison camp. Lester escapes along with an alien captive known as ""Buddy"" and the two of them must evade capture while travelling through a series of dangerous environments, battling alien soldiers and wild creatures while solving numerous puzzles in order to survive. The duo traverse the prison complex, a cave system and a tower structure. In the game's climax, Lester is severely wounded by one of the aliens, but with the help of his alien friend, manages to kill his attacker and escape. After reaching the top of the tower, Lester collapses, but is promptly joined by Buddy, who picks Lester up and the two escape on a dragon-like creature, flying off to the horizon.  "

35,Ape Out,/wiki/Ape_Out,Action,Gabe Cuzzillo,Devolver Digital,"February 28, 2019","February 28, 2019","February 28, 2019"," Ape Out is a single player beat 'em up video game played from a top-down perspective. The player controls a gorilla running through a maze while evading enemies in the form of gun-wielding humans. The human enemies are easily killed with a single attack and can also be grabbed and used as a shield; however, as they are armed with guns, they can quickly kill the player as well. The principal aim of the game is to escape each level and killing enemies is not technically required in order to proceed.  The maze design is randomized and is slightly different on each play, making it impossible to memorize the layout of a level.  One of the game's main themes is jazz music and each of the game's four chapters are represented as jazz albums with each level representing one track. The gameplay features a loud and chaotic, all-percussion jazz soundtrack composed by Matt Boch (associate arts professor at NYU Game Center) which reacts dynamically to the gameplay, for example by increasing in intensity as the player faces more enemies, crashing cymbals each time an enemy is killed and adjusting the volume according to one's speed and number of kills.  In order to provide a reactive and procedurally generated soundtrack for each playthrough, the game draws from a bank of thousands of recorded individual drum sounds, some recorded by Boch with others sourced externally, and combines them according to player movement. The system will also match the location of what is happening on screen to the drum or cymbal which matches that approximate location on a real drum kit. Each chapter of the game also features a different style of jazz percussion, with Boch describing the first chapter as the most quintessentially jazz, whereas other chapters feature more unusual instruments for jazz music.  The game also features a minimalist art style which has been compared to that of Saul Bass.  "
36,Apex Legends,/wiki/Apex_Legends,First-person shooter,Respawn Entertainment,Electronic Arts,Unreleased,2020,2020," Apex Legends is an online multiplayer battle royale game featuring squads of three players using pre-made characters (called ""Legends""), similar to those of hero shooters. Alternate modes have been introduced allowing for single and for two-player squads since the game's release.  Each match generally features twenty teams of three-player squads. Players can join friends in a squad or can be matched randomly with other players. Before the match, each player on the squad selects one of the 13 playable characters (as of Season 5), with the exception that no character may be selected more than once by a squad. Each character in the squad has a unique design, personality, and abilities that provide different playstyles to the team. All teams are then placed on an aircraft that passes over the game map. One player in each squad is the jumpmaster, selecting when the squad should skydive out of the aircraft and where to land with the concurrence of the other squad members. However, players are free to deviate from the squad's path.  Once on the ground, the squad can scavenge for weapons, armor, and other equipment that is scattered around buildings, or in crates randomly distributed around the map, while keeping an eye out for other squads. Apex Legends includes a nonverbal communication ""ping system"" which allows players to use their game controller to communicate to their squad certain directions, weapon locations, enemies, and suggested strategies. While the game offers movement options similar to other shooters, it includes some of the gameplay features of previous Titanfall games, such as the ability to climb over short walls, slide down inclined surfaces, and use zip-lines to traverse an area quickly.  Players who become knocked down in the course of a game can be revived by their squadmates. Should a player be killed completely, they can still be resurrected if their team member(s) collect their respawn banner, which appears at the place where they died, and bring it to one of several beacons on the island. The banner, however, must be collected within a time limit, before expiring and fully eliminating the player.  Over time, the game's safe zone will reduce in size around a randomly-selected point on the map; players outside the safe zone take damage and may die if they do not reach the safe zone in time. This also confines squads to smaller spaces to force encounters. The last squad with any members left alive is crowned the ""Apex Champions"" of that match. Players are awarded in-game currency based on their squad's placement as well as experience points.  Apex Legends is a free-to-play game, monetized through microtransactions and loot boxes, which allow the player to spend both real money and in-game currency on cosmetic items, such as outfits for the Legends and new colors for weapons.

Heroes start the game at a low level, and can earn gold and experience (XP) in various ways: Killing non-player creatures such as minions or monsters, defeating other players, destroying structures, passively through time and through special items that can be purchased through the shop. Earning experience unlocks and augments abilities, making the hero more powerful. Items purchased in the shop do not carry over matches, and therefore all players are on equal footing at the start of every match.  Matches give players rewards, such as gold, which can then be used to buy a variety of heroes or arcana. In addition to this, players can play a 'Ranked' match type, which allows them to be matched with players who are at their skill level and be assessed through in-game 'ranks'. Stars are earnt for a victory, and lost when the player loses.  "

Players use cards they draw from a deck to cast spells, recruit followers, heal wounds, or use items that grant special abilities. Cards may also be played as ""Perils"" which can be laid on specific tiles to act as traps for other heroes or used immediately in combat, and other cards may be used to forge temporary alliances. Armello also features a day/night cycle where certain heroes gain advantages based on the time of day, and certain groups of enemies only appear in either the darkness or light.  There are four alternative paths to victory and every hero is best suited for reaching a particular one, but every victory condition can be reached with every hero.  and characters  The game takes place in the ""dark fairy tale"" Kingdom of Armello, a world filled with anthropomorphic animals separated into numerous clans.

53,Assassin's Creed III Remastered,/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed_III_Remastered,Action-adventure,Ubisoft Montreal,Ubisoft,"May 23, 2019","May 21, 2019","May 21, 2019"," Assassin's Creed III is a third-person action-adventure title set in an open world in which the player uses a combination of stealth, parkour, and combat to complete various missions. The player takes the role of three characters during the course of the game. The main character is Desmond Miles, a 21st-century Assassin, working to uncover the secrets of a mysterious Precursor Vault that will protect the Earth from an upcoming solar flare on December 21, 2012. To uncover the secrets, Desmond uses the Animus to live out memories of two of his ancestors which the player controls during these sequences, both set at the time of the American Revolutionary War. The first briefly played at the start of the game, is Haytham Kenway, a British Templar who seeks the location of the Vault. The second and the primary character for the game is Ratonhnhaké:ton, the result of a brief liaison between Kenway and a Native American woman. Ratonhnhaké:ton takes on the name Connor to blend in better with colonial society. When playing as Connor, the player has access to a huge wilderness known as the Frontier (which is 1.5 times bigger than Rome in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood), the cities of Boston and New York City. Portions of the Eastern Seaboard and Caribbean Sea can be explored via the flagship of the Assassins' navy, the Aquila, captained by Connor Kenway himself, with Robert Faulkner his first-mate advising and teaching him in the ways of the sea.  Free running has been simplified to allow for more fluid parkour in the cities and wilderness, such as climbing and running on trees, mountains, cliffs, etc. Close combat has been modified, allowing Connor to dual-wield weapons and take down multiple opponents at once and players no longer need to manage the lock-on mechanic. Aiding this, Connor has access to a wide range of weapons which include muskets, swords, pistols, native weapons such as the tomahawk and bow and arrow, a rope dart (used to pull foes or hang them, while on a tree) as well as the Hidden Blades. In addition, the left Hidden Blade has a folding mechanism for blocking attacks, skinning an animal, and performing high-profile assassinations. Human shields can be used against firing lines of enemies. Medicine is no longer used as health recovers automatically. Stealth is also revamped, allowing players to use natural elements such as tall grass and trees to hide, along with the ability to blend between any two people.  Assassin's Creed III features new weather simulations such as snow, fog, and rain. The seasons can also change i.e., Summer and Winter, which not only affect visuals but also gameplay, as the player will find that they run slower in deep snow. Snowfall can reduce visibility for the player and enemies, aiding stealth. Unlike the past games, this one includes animals varying from domestic (horses, cows, dogs) to wild (deer, wolves, bears). The wild ones are found in the Frontier and can be hunted for meat or marrow in order to be sold. The quality of the kill determines the price, encouraging the player to hunt silently. For this, traps and bait can also be used.  The economy is now based on the Davenport Homestead, which also acts as Connor's adoptive home. The site can be visited by people such as carpenters, tailors, etc. suffering from displacement due to the war. Helping and interacting with these non-player characters (NPCs) will encourage them to settle in the Homestead. From there on, the player can craft various items and trade with them, and then sell the goods to the cities via caravan. The player can also help them build relationships with each other, which will then result in the formation of a small village. The player can also upgrade the Homestead manor as well as Connor's ship, the Aquila.  A revamped version of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood's recruitment feature returns as players can enlist citizens to the Assassins' cause by completing ""Liberation"" missions. They also have a much larger skill set, which allows them to start a riot, provide a covert escort, act as a personal bodyguard, etc. Other side missions include collecting Almanac pages, exploring tunnels to locate fast-travel stations, joining hunting and fighting clubs, investigating frontiersman rumors about UFOs and Sasquatch, ""peg-leg"" missions in which Connor goes to underground forts and wastelands to uncover the legend of Captain Kidd's treasure, and others.  Assassin's Creed III also features naval expeditions. Using Connor's warship, the Aquila, the player can navigate the high seas. Control of the ship relies on environmental factors such as wind direction and speed, local presence of storms, high waves, and rocks. Engagements are by cannon, with broadsides covering both flanks of the ship, swivel guns that can be used to damage smaller ships which can also be boarded to find treasure, and chain shots from the broadsides as well to take down the masts of larger ships and disable them. The Aquila is used in the side missions known as ""Privateer missions"" and is also used in some of the main missions. In addition, Assassin's Creed III is actually the first release in the franchise to have minigames including Bowls, Checkers, Fanorona and Nine men's morris.  The Wii U version of the game has extra features. The player has the ability to change weapons on the go and the map is always visible on the Wii U Gamepad. The Wii U version also supports Off TV Play. With this feature enabled, the main screen is redirected to the Wii U Gamepad.  Online multiplayer returns in this installment by Ubisoft Annecy. Along with returning modes, new ones feature a co-operative mode named Wolfpack, in which 1–4 players are charged with killing certain NPCs within a time limit, through a sequence of 25 stages. It also features Domination, a team mode where players will have to capture certain areas of the map, protecting them from the opposing team.  The remastered version of the game features more revamped mechanics. Players can now whistle from anywhere while hidden, whereas the previous version of the game only allowed whistling from corners. Double assassinations have been improved so as not to require entering high-profile mode to do so. Free-aiming with ranged weapons was also made possible, allowing Connor more control over his bow and pistols, much like in Black Flag and Rogue. The mini-map and the UI were upgraded with better-looking and easier-to-recognize icons for ease of accessibility, figuring out where enemies will point next and also features color-blind modes. The crafting system and the economy system was also vastly upgraded. The game's lighting system has been upgraded to resemble the newly-implemented technology in Assassin's Creed: Origins and the textures have also been revamped to resemble the future AnvilNext 2.0 Assassin's Creed games.  "
54,Assassin's Creed Odyssey,/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed_Odyssey,Action role-playing,Ubisoft Quebec,Ubisoft,"October 5, 2018",Unreleased,Unreleased," Assassin's Creed Odyssey places more emphasis on role-playing elements than previous games in the series. The game contains dialogue options, branching quests and multiple endings. The player is able to choose between siblings Alexios and Kassandra as to whom they use as the main character. The game features a notoriety system in which mercenaries chase after the player if they commit crimes like killing or stealing in the presence of others.  The player character is a Greek mercenary and a descendant of the Spartan king Leonidas I. They inherit his broken spear, which is forged into a blade to become a weapon that grants the player special abilities in combat. The game uses a skill tree system that allows the player to unlock new abilities. The three skill trees are ""hunter"", which focuses on ranged attacks through the use of a bow & arrow, ""warrior"", which focuses on weapons-based combat (swords, spears, axes etc.), and ""assassin"", which focuses on stealth and silent take-downs. This replaces the system used in Origins, which granted the player a series of passive abilities.  The hitbox combat system introduced in Origins returns and is expanded upon to grant the player access to different special skills when the ability bar fills up. These skills include calling a rain of arrows and a powerful kick to knock opponents off-balance, and are similar to the ""Overpower"" mechanic introduced in Origins that let the player use a powerful finishing move in combat. The game features a gear system in which each piece of armor the player wears has different statistics and provides a range of advantages. These can be equipped and upgraded individually. The ""eagle vision"" mode, which was used by the franchise to give the player the ability to scout an area by highlighting enemies and objects, has been replaced by a golden eagle named Ikaros as a companion, similar to Senu in Origins.  Assassin's Creed Odyssey features naval combat again, with the player having access to Hellenistic-era warships to explore the Aegean Sea. The conflict between Athens and Sparta is represented through a ""War System"" which enables players to take contracts from mercenaries and participate in different large-scale battles against hostile factions. The war system can change a faction's influence over a region.  The player can develop romantic relationships with non-playable characters of both genders, regardless of their own character's gender. Creative director Jonathan Dumont commented that ""since the story is choice-driven, we never force players in romantic situations they might not be comfortable with (...) I think this allows everybody to build the relationships they want, which I feel respects everybody’s roleplay style and desires."" Players and critics appreciated this inclusion of queer romance options. However, many reacted negatively to a plot development in the Legacy of the First Blade downloadable content in which the player character has no choice but to enter into a relationship and have a child with a person of the opposite gender, considering that this invalidated their character's identity and the role-playing aspects previously emphasized by Ubisoft. Ubisoft responded that ""we strive to give players choice whenever possible in Odyssey and apologize to those surprised by the events in this episode"". Ubisoft later stated that the forced romance would be removed with a future patch along with a modified cutscene. However, this consisted of editing the cutscene slightly so that the player could tell their partner they were only doing it for the blood-line - the child is still compulsory.  "

59,Astral Chain,/wiki/Astral_Chain,Action,PlatinumGames,Nintendo,"August 30, 2019","August 30, 2019","August 30, 2019"," Astral Chain is an action-adventure game where the player assumes the role of a detective from the ""Neuron"" special police task force, who are tasked with solving cases and investigating incidents that take place in ""The Ark"", the game's main world. Exploring the world, questioning non-playable characters and examining evidence yields clues and logic puzzles that become ""leads"" which further the investigation process. During the course of the game the officers access the ""Astral Plane""—an interdimensional area where they must traverse hazardous terrain, solve puzzles, and battle enemies, similar to that of traditional video game dungeons.  Neuron officers are able to summon a tethered familiar known as a ""Legion"", bound by a chain that is the game's namesake. Legions come in various different forms sporting different abilities that are used both for puzzle-solving and combat. These include: a sword-based Legion with swift blade attacks that can be used to sever circuitry and interrupt enemy attacks, an archer Legion that can target weak points and distant switches, a Legion with powerful punches that can move large objects, an axe-based Legion which generates a shield and can destroy breakable objects and enemy shields, and a K9 Legion that can track scents, unearth hidden objects, and also be ridden for added mobility and evasiveness. The player begins the game with the Sword Legion, capturing the other four over the course of the game. Legions can be swapped at any time during battle, and can also be upgraded via experience points and unlockable skills. On top of the player's own health, Legions have their own individual health meter that gradually depletes while they are summoned, and they are also susceptible to enemy attacks, which depletes higher amounts of their health. Their health regenerates automatically when they're not active. If the entirety of a Legion's health is depleted, the player becomes unable to utilize it until it has restored all of its health.  Combat takes place in real-time, both melee and ranged weapons are used to fight enemies, predominantly the malevolent race of ""Chimeras"". Players can summon the Legion during combat in order to have them automatically fight with the player to create combo attacks. The Legion can be manually controlled with the right analog stick, allowing the player to position the Legion for more specific maneuvers. Additional skills include being able to perform powerful health-restorative finishing moves, unchaining a Legion to summon multiple at once, using the chain that connects the player to the Legion in order to bind enemies — referred to as a ""Chain Bind"" — and also using the chain as a tripwire on enemies that attempt charging into the player — referred to as a ""Chain Counter"". The player is also able to utilize the chain in order to zip line out of danger through enemy crowds, as well as crossing gaps and bottomless pits between buildings and platforms.  Completing combos, interrupting enemy attacks, restraining enemies, dodging, and deploying a Legion at the correct moment will offer the player a chance to perform a sync attack, requiring the player to press the left trigger at the right instant, similar to a quick time event. Sync attacks can extend combos, trigger special attacks, bind enemies, and help the player recover from a fall. After performing a large number of sync attacks, the player may fuse with their Legion for a short while to recover health and deal large amounts of damage.  The game features four difficulty settings, allowing the player to switch difficulty between each chapter. The highest difficulty is only unlocked for a corresponding chapter once the player has beaten it once. When played on the two highest difficulties, the game ranks the player based on their individual case performance, giving the player an overall ranking at the end of each chapter. On the two lowest difficulties, the player will not be ranked.  Early in the game players unlock the IRIS tool, a heads up display from which they can inspect the environment and search for clues, as well as save their progress, manage the inventory, customize in-game menus, view the level map, and manage orders (benchmarks and photo challenges that reward the player with items, crafting materials, XP, money, and photo filters).  Players may choose to play previous chapters from their desk at the Neuron Headquarters at the beginning of each new chapter. The player can also return to this area to maintain and customize their Legions, customize their character, and interact with other Neuron officers. Consumable items can also be obtained from vendors that can later be used for crafting, health recovery, or combat.   "

71,Axiom Verge,/wiki/Axiom_Verge,Metroidvania,Thomas Happ Games,BadLand Games,"October 5, 2017","October 5, 2017","October 5, 2017"," Axiom Verge is a side-scroller action-adventure game where the player controls Trace, a scientist who, after suffering a crippling injury, wakes up in an ancient and high-tech world. The game focuses on action and exploration, and features over 60 items and power-ups. The gameplay borrows elements from classic games such as Metroid, Contra, Blaster Master, and Bionic Commando, among others.   Trace, a scientist is running a lab experiment in New Mexico, U.S. when an explosion knocks him out. He awakens inside an egg-shaped machine on the alien world of Sudra. A disembodied voice leads Trace to The Axiom Disruptor, a powerful gun. Trace explores Sudra, using the gun to protect himself from massive monsters that attack him in the name of ""Athetos"". Trace reawakens inside similar egg-shaped machines each time he dies, and defeats each beast one by one.  Trace eventually reaches the source of the voice: a massive and broken mechanical head named Elsenova. Elsenova tells Trace he must reactivate a piece of Sudran machinery called a ""Power Filter"" or she will die. Trace agrees to help. After Trace finds and repairs the Power Filter, Elsenova explains that the universe is divided in two: the Worldstream and the Breach. The Breach is a massive storm between worlds. Sudra exists to keep the Breach in check. But long ago, a man named Athetos emerged from the Breach and eradicated the Sudrans by releasing a pathogen. The only survivors were mechanical giants like Elsenova, known as the Rusalki. Unable to defeat them, Athetos used a Breach Attractor machine to envelop Sudra in the Breach and trap the Rusalki on the planet. Elsenova says that another Rusalka, Ophelia, entered the Breach and found Trace inside. Trace agrees to reactivate the Rusalki's repair drones and revive Ophelia, so that he can retrieve more answers from her.  On the way, Trace discovers two more Rusalki. Elsenova explains that the first, Veruska, is a dangerous ally who has power over dreams. The second, Katrahashka, was killed by the other Rusalki after siding with Athetos. Elsenova also reveals that the monsters Trace encounters are Athetos's former followers, warped by the pathogen they once spread.  Trace successfully reactivates the repair drones needed to fix Ophelia, but soon begins hallucinating. Elsenova realizes that Trace has contracted the pathogen, and explains he must get to Ophelia to stop the infection. Trace struggles to Ophelia, but the infection progresses until he becomes delirious and collapses.  While unconscious, Trace begins to remember life on Earth after the explosion in New Mexico. The explosion was an accident caused by a frozen valve. Trace lost his ability to walk and became partially blind, but the incident gave him a new perspective and allowed him to formulate a new, revolutionary theory of physics. Trace's published ideas were ridiculed by the scientific community, who shunned him, leading them to start calling him ""Athetos"" (meaning ""without place"" in Greek).  Trace awakens in front of Ophelia. Ophelia explains she retrieved him using drones and she treated the pathogen. Ophelia also explains that Earth is one of many worlds in the Breach, as well as the homeworld of Athetos. Ophelia claims she was damaged when she entered the Breach to find a ""PatternMind"" from Earth – someone who can manipulate reality at will – and extracted Trace. Ophelia says only PatternMinds can survive the pathogen or use the Axiom Disruptor, although she does not know what exactly makes Trace a PatternMind. Elsenova reveals that Athetos is above them in a space elevator containing the Breach Attractor machine. If Trace can destroy it, she promises the Rusalki will send him home. Trace suspects the Rusalki know that he and Athetos are somehow the same person, but keeps silent.  Trace proceeds through Sudra, finding a disfigured clone of Athetos. The player can choose to watch the clone die, or kill it. Trace realizes the massive monsters are actually mutated clones of Athetos, and demands answers from the Rusalki. Ophelia reveals that Athetos first came to Sudra as a young man and recorded his biological data using the strange egg-shaped machine inside which Trace awoke. The original Athetos then re-entered the Breach, emerging after a long time to begin his genocide. The Rusalka hoped that a clone of the young Athetos would help them against his older self, and used Athetos' recorded data to create Trace. Trace expresses distrust of the Rusalka and insists on talking to Athetos personally. Elsenova responds by remotely killing Trace.  Trace reawakens inside another egg-shaped machine. Ophelia contacts him and explains she revived him. Ophelia proposes that she will allow Trace to speak with Athetos so long as he shuts down the Breach Attractor. In the meantime, she will persuade Elsenova. Trace agrees. Ophelia then shows Trace to the hangar where the Rusalki's bodies are kept, revealing that they are in fact massive war machines that could obliterate Athetos if only Trace disables the Breach Attractor.  As Trace approaches the elevator where Athetos waits, Elsenova appears with her fully repaired body. She tells Trace that although she cannot survive in the Breach, she will help Trace fight Athetos if he disables the Breach Attractor. She also apologizes for killing Trace, and promises that in exchange for Trace's cooperation she will not kill Athetos.  Trace reaches Athetos's elevator. He finds Athetos suspended in a massive tank of liquid designed to protect him from the pathogen. Trace demands answers, but Athetos claims the Rusalki would kill Trace if he learned the whole truth. However, Athetos does explain that there is a world beyond Sudra with even more advanced technology. Sudra used to be a port to that advanced world, but over time the Sudrans forgot their technological expertise and saw the outside universe as religiously taboo. To reach the advanced world and bring its technology back to Earth, Athetos exterminated the Sudran people. However, the Rusalki's survival halted Athetos' plan. Rather than let such powerful enemies roam free in the universe, Athetos decided to trap them. He attracted the Breach to Sudra and shut down the Rusalki's maintenance technology, but not before they destroyed a portable device that protected Athetos against the pathogen and forced him into the tank.  Trace decides to fight Athetos alongside Elsenova, and they destroy the Breach Attractor machine. However, Elsenova claims Athetos is too dangerous and breaks her promise, killing Athetos. Elsenova tells Trace that the Rusalki will now return him home. Trace is mysteriously overtaken by exhaustion and falls asleep.  Trace awakens back to Earth after the lab accident, finding history has been altered so that the explosion did not injure him. However, Trace develops an obsession with returning to Sudra and quits his job to research it, following Athetos' path. If the player ends the game with a high completion rate, just as Trace is about to succeed on his research, Athetos himself appears and tells Trace he cannot outrun himself. After telling Trace that it is ""time to wake up"", Athetos shoots Trace.  "

76,Azure Striker Gunvolt 3,/wiki/Azure_Striker_Gunvolt_3,Action,Inti Creates,Inti Creates,TBA,TBA,TBA," Like the Mega Man series, namely the original series, Mega Man X, Mega Man Zero and Mega Man ZX, Azure Striker Gunvolt is a side-scrolling action platform game. The player controls the eponymous Gunvolt, who is able to jump, dash, and utilize a gun with special bullets that ""tag"" their targets, which grants a homing effect to Gunvolt's electric fields. Hitting an enemy with multiple tags will guide more of Gunvolt's electricity towards that enemy, increasing damage. The player's actions are limited by an energy bar, which depletes when using the electrical field, using additional movement abilities such as double-jumping or air dashing, or being hit by enemies. Whenever the energy bar is depleted, Gunvolt will enter an ""Overheat"" state and will be unable to use his septimal powers or defend himself until it refills.  focuses heavily on the player's technique and skill in moving through stages. While finishing a stage is relatively easy, the game provides a ranking system as well as several optional challenges. The game introduces a ""chain"" system in which the player's score is constantly increased so long as the player avoids being hit by enemies, with special actions such as defeating an enemy in the air or defeating multiple enemies at one time providing an additional bonus. The game uses an item-forging and equipping system, the former of which is instrumental in achieving the game's true ending.  Additionally, Gunvolt has access to several super move-like skills called Offensive Skills, which allow him to perform powerful attacks or heal himself. Each of the game's bosses also have their own Offensive Skills, which are triggered when their health bar drops below a certain level, or in the case of Elise, one of the bosses, when one of her halves is killed before the other. Speaking to Joule in Gunvolt's apartment in between stages also increases the chance of being brought back to life by Lumen when he dies in a stage, which gives Gunvolt unlimited Septimal energy, but at the cost of a higher stage ranking. Gunvolt can also level-up when he gains a certain amount of experience from defeating certain enemies.   Azure Striker Gunvolt is set during an unspecified date in the near future, in which several people called ""adepts"" have developed ""septimal powers"". These powers enable superhuman feats including flight, the use of powerful energy weapons, and manipulation of the elements like fire, water, and electricity. The world is at peace thanks to the efforts of a world-spanning corporation known as the Sumeragi Group. However, the Sumeragi Group is, in reality, controlling and experimenting on adepts. Gunvolt, one of the most powerful adepts, has the ability to create electrical fields and works for an organization known as QUILL, which is seeking to reveal and put a stop to Sumeragi's ulterior motives.  The game opens with Gunvolt assigned on a mission to assassinate an adept named Lumen. He is told that Lumen has the ability to resonate with and control any adepts through her singing, and is considered dangerous. However, Gunvolt discovers that Lumen is the septimal projection of a young girl named Joule, who is a captive of Sumeragi's scientists, and can't bring himself to kill her. He instead rescues her, leading him to amicably defect from QUILL and set out on his own to protect her. He becomes a freelance agent, but still works jobs for QUILL from time to time.  Six months after defecting from QUILL, Gunvolt is offered a freelance assignment by Moniqa, his handler from QUILL, to investigate and take out several agents of the Sumeragi Group. The Sumeragi agents are all adepts as well, but powered by strange Glaives, which house their septimal essences, and are representative of each of the Seven Deadly Sins. The first agent, Merak, is a lazy, unenthusiastic adept with the power to bend space for use in his attacks. The second, Jota, is a prideful agent with the power to manipulate light. The third, Viper, is loud, brash, and violent, has control over fire, and harbors a jealous rage against Gunvolt for Joule. The fourth, Carerra, uses magnetic fists and waves to draw his enemies close before destroying them with a powerful pulsewave. The fifth, Elise, is a split personality adept: her meek, timid side and her brash, assertive side are at constant odds, but her ability to raise the dead allows for even adepts to come back from defeat. The sixth, Stratos, is a drug-addicted adept with an insatiable hunger for the very drug that keeps what little of his sanity remains in check, and has control over swarms of insects. The seventh, the bigender and carnal Zonda, attacks and wounds Zeno, one of Gunvolt's friends from QUILL, but is seemingly killed by a human warrior named Copen, who harbors a major hatred for adepts and carries a gun capable of firing bullets that can suppress their powers. Copen warns Gunvolt that they are not on the same side, and after a brief skirmish, retreats.  After defeating the Sumeragi agents, Gunvolt's apartment is invaded, and Joule is kidnapped by a resurrected Merak. Gunvolt gives chase, destroying Merak for good, and rides a space elevator to a Sumeragi orbiting platform. Along the way, he encounters the resurrected Stratos, Jota, and Viper and fights them all to the death, before finding that Elise herself had a hidden feral and wild third personality; responsible for the resurrection of the agents. This third personality is killed by Copen, and Gunvolt is forced to fight and subdue him. Gunvolt finally encounters the leadership of Sumeragi, a young psychic adept named Nova. He uses Lumen in combat against Gunvolt, before summoning Joule and three Glaives into himself to transform into a monstrous beast. Gunvolt manages to kill Nova and escape with Joule. In the initial ending, Gunvolt runs into Asimov, his father figure and the leader of QUILL, who offers Gunvolt and Joule new places in QUILL, and reveals an ulterior motive: with Sumeragi in shambles, Asimov wishes to use Lumen, along with the Sumeragi satellite, to wipe out the human race as payback for suppression of adepts. Gunvolt refuses his offer, telling Asimov that he is no better than Sumeragi was, and Asimov responds by shooting him through the heart using Copen's gun (implying that he defeated Copen to steal it from him), before turning the gun on Joule and shooting her as well, leaving them both for dead.  However, if Gunvolt is wearing a special pendant Joule made for him, which is made of collectable jewels that are hidden within each stage, this ending will be revealed as a dream and the true ending will occur instead. The true ending sees Gunvolt on the verge of death as in the initial ending, but he is then rescued by Lumen at the last minute. He awakens to find Joule's body, deathly cold and still. Heartbroken, Gunvolt screams in sadness until he hears Lumen's voice, and ultimately realizes that, in an act of love in order to save his life and be with him wherever he goes, Joule forsook her physical form by fusing her mind and personality with Lumen before further fusing herself into Gunvolt's septimal energy, which amplifies Gunvolt's power to its utmost limits. After this revelation, Gunvolt chases down Asimov, running into Carrera along the way. Carrera demands vengeance for his prior defeat, but is killed once and for all by Gunvolt. Continuing onward to the elevator, Gunvolt confronts Asimov, who reveals himself to have the same electrical septimal powers as Gunvolt. With no other choice, Gunvolt fights him to the death. Following this final battle, Asimov warns Gunvolt that he will never be truly free of conflicts in his life, and dies from his wounds. Zeno and Moniqa meet the space elevator as it arrives, only to find Asimov dead and a heartbroken, wounded Gunvolt, who offers no explanation as to what happened before he simply wanders away into the morning light to be alone with Joule.

Each level contains various movable word tiles, corresponding to specific types of objects and obstacles on the field (such as Baba itself, the goal flag, walls and environmental hazards, and other creatures), linking operators such as ""is"" and ""and"", and verb tiles reflecting the properties of these objects (such as ""you"", which makes the object become controlled by the player, ""push"" to make them movable, ""stop"" to make them impassable, ""win"" to specify the goal, ""sink"" to make items drown in it, and so on). The objective of each level is for the player to reach the goal by manipulating these tiles to create or modify ""rules"" by which they behave. For example, the goal can be changed by moving ""is"" and ""win"" blocks to another object, and the player can travel through objects by removing the ""stop"" trait from them. Levels can force specific rules by placing their blocks in a corner, so they cannot be moved. The game contains over 200 levels.  "

The main goal is to defend the kingdom from the attacking Viking invaders who killed the king, and to guide the island's people to evacuate. Islands have different layouts so each poses a different challenge. They are divided into multiple tiles and have houses, with Vikings attacking from any corner, so the player's strategy must be well planned to get the opportunity to save the people from the enemy by protecting the houses. The Viking invaders will chuck torches into the houses, and if they burn completely the player will not earn coins for those houses. Gold is needed to get upgrades for units and level up commanders' defenses. The player can also pick up items (represented as question marks in the map) and add new commanders to the Army.  "

83,The Banner Saga,/wiki/The_Banner_Saga,Role-playing,Stoic Studio,Versus Evil,Unreleased,"May 17, 2018","May 17, 2018"," The Banner Saga is an interactive story, meaning that several events may or may not happen depending on the player's choices. The game follows two playable characters, each having their own story that ultimately merges into one. The core of the game is a single-player campaign of turn-based combat engagements inspired by games such as Final Fantasy Tactics and Shining Force, with the player controlling and being able to build up a party of characters with complementary abilities. The game deliberately avoids certain conventions of action-oriented computer role-playing games such as the focus on a young lone hero's story, looting and buying items, or reloading a saved game state after defeat. Instead, the developers intended to tell the story of the player's caravan as a whole, and encourage players to accept and deal with the consequences of any defeats they may encounter.  The Banner Saga centers on the return of the Dredge - a warlike race that despises humans - led by Bellower, a nigh invincible Dredge who leads them on a warpath. As a wandering army sent to fight against the Dredge and find a weakness for Bellower, the caravan make many difficult decisions that would shape the fate of both man and Varl. Meanwhile, a darkness starts to encompass the world as a giant serpent causes massive earthquakes and breaches across the lands.   The game takes place in a Viking legend-inspired world, stuck in a perpetual twilight since the sun stopped moving weeks before the events of the game, mainly populated by humans and giant-like creatures called the Varls, as the Dredge, an ancient race believed to be extinct for ages, returns to kill them all.  On the west, the Varl Vognir, together with several other companions that include his longtime friend Hakon, the retired Varl warrior Ubin, and the resourceful human Eirik, are charged with escorting Ludin, Prince of the human capital Arberrang, to the Varl capital Grofheim in order to seal an alliance between the two races. In the city of Vedrfell however, Vognir is slain in an encounter with Dredge, leading Hakon to take command of the caravan. Continuing their way, the caravan faces many of the Dredge, and, while exploring the city in ruins of Ridgehorn, find an unconscious man next to a woman's dead body on the top of a tower. As they rescue him and continue their way, the man, Eyvind, unsuccessfully implores Hakon to return to Ridgehorn, convinced his companion is still alive. The caravan reaches Grofheim, to find it aflame and completely overrun by Dredge.  On the other side of the country, the hunter Rook and his daughter Alette encounter a lone Dredge near their home of Skogr. They hastily come back to their town and their Varl friend Iver, to find the village attacked by the Dredge. Together with the Chieftain's wife Oddleif and the other survivors of the village, they escape to the town of Frostvellr. Finding the town unsafe, they continue their quest for shelter, eventually having no choice but to seek refuge in the Varl fortress of Einartoft. On their way, terrible earthquakes occur, seemingly caused by a massive form in the distance. Although the Varl of Einartoft refuse to let humans in at first, Iver, whose real identity is a legendary, long-disappeared warrior known as Yngvar, persuades them to let the caravan in.  In Einartoft, Rook, Alette and their companions meet Hakon, Prince Ludin, and their own companions who also took shelter in the fortress after discovering what was left of Grofheim. They all meet with the Varl King, Jorundr. The situation is soon revealed to be desperate here as well, as Einartoft is under siege from the Dredge and their immortal champion, Bellower. With the king refusing to destroy the bridge leading to the fortress, the companions have no choice but to fight the Dredge, leading to Iver being severely wounded and losing an arm in a fight against Bellower. As Eyvind tries to distract Bellower and save Iver, the massive form they saw in the distance earlier, a massive, terrifying serpent, emerges and gives a glance at the battle before going away, causing the Dredge to retreat in fear.  Meanwhile, Juno, the woman whose body was next to Eyvind when Hakon's caravan found him, awakens in the ruins of Ridgehorn, to find the gigantic serpent facing her. After unsuccessfully trying to kill her, the serpent speaks to her, revealing he was supposed to swallow what was left of the world, but is deeply troubled by the presence of a ""darkness"" taking over the world instead. After he leaves, Juno contacts Eyvind by telepathy, urging him to leave Einartoft and meet her down south in the city of Sigrholm.  Eyvind pleads with Rook to lead him to Sigrholm. Rook agrees, as Einartoft is already doomed, and the caravan leaves, soon warned by Ubin and other survivors catching them that the city fell a few hours after they left. When the caravan reaches the unwelcoming city of Sigrholm, Juno is nowhere to be found; despite Eyvind's protests, Rook decides the only hope they have left is to find shelter in the fortified city of Boersgard. However, they find another city in the brink of chaos, with no boats left, and where a group of mercenaries named the Ravens, led by the Varl Bolverk, rules the city. Boersgard finds itself stuck between the sea and a Dredge host. More Dredge arrive every day, while supplies are running out and widespread riots are tearing the city apart from the inside, as Rook and his friends decide their only hope resides in building new boats to leave by the sea before it is too late. As the city's defenses are about to fall before their goal is achieved, they are saved by Juno, together with Hakon, Prince Ludin, and an army of Varl who escaped Einartoft at the last moment. Despite this brief moment of triumph, they soon find themselves in more trouble as Bellower and yet more Dredge arrive. With the help of Rook, Juno creates a magic arrow; the Dredge would rout if Bellower was defeated, and although he is immortal, the arrow would hit his mind, convincing him of his own death and making him fall into a coma. The player is given the choice to give the arrow to either Rook or Alette; the one chosen ultimately hits Bellower, allowing their companions to defeat him and make the Dredge army flee, but is killed by Bellower after shooting him. Some time later, the caravans of Rook and Hakon, unified as one, leave Boersgard together with the Ravens on newly constructed boats, afflicted with grief, after giving Rook/Alette a proper farewell and funeral.

It also introduces The Horseborn, a centaur-like race. Several heroes from the original return as playable characters, and many of the choices made in the first game have a direct impact in the second.    In a 2015 interview with Rock Paper Shotgun, Stoic's writer Drew McGee noted that combat in the first game was often criticized as slow and lacking in diversity.  The development team therefore prioritized creating new enemies and enemy types for players to face, giving them new abilities and buffs while also adding more win scenarios and variations in combat. The range and scope of choices available to the players - both in combat and in the overall narrative - has also been expanded.  "

86,Baroque,/wiki/Baroque_(video_game),Role-playing,Sting Entertainment,Sting Entertainment,2020,Unreleased,Unreleased," The objective of Baroque is to guide the nameless amnesiac player character through the Neuro Tower to the bottom floor. Randomly generated, the majority of the layouts of the Neuro Tower's floors change each time the player ventures inside. Portals found on each floor of the tower will transport the player to the next floor. Death in Baroque does not result in a game over screen, but advances the plot, unlocking cutscenes, new areas, and comments by the non-player characters. The Neuro Tower expands after certain conditions are met.  The player character begins the game outside of the Neuro Tower with no items or experience points. Before entering the Neuro Tower, the player is presented with an Angelic Rifle, a special weapon that can destroy any monster with a single shot. However, the rifle has an ammunition capacity of five shots. The player can find items, swords, and equipment scattered around the tower at random and by defeating enemies—which also grants the player experience points, allowing the player character to gain levels and become more powerful. However, should the protagonist die before reaching the end of the dungeon, the player will be returned to the starting point outside the tower, and will lose all items, including those equipped, and all gained experience points. By throwing an item into a consciousness orb, the player can retrieve it from one of the non-player characters on the next play-through. Up to five items can be saved in this manner at the start, but the number can increase if certain conditions are met.  The game uses two gauges to measure the protagonist's health: hit points and vitality. The vitality gauge constantly drains during gameplay. If it empties, the hit point gauge will begin to drain. Both gauges can be refilled by eating various forms of flesh and hearts to restore hit points and vitality respectively. If flesh or a heart is consumed while the relevant stat is filled to maximum, the protagonist's maximum hit points/vitality will increase by a fixed amount.   "
87,Bastion,/wiki/Bastion_(video_game),Puzzle,Supergiant Games,Supergiant Games,"September 13, 2018","September 13, 2018","September 13, 2018"," Bastion is an action role-playing game with a level structure. The player character, ""the Kid"", moves through floating, fantasy-themed environments that form paths as the player approaches the edge. Levels consist of a single plane, and are viewed isometrically. They are filled with enemies of various types, which attempt to harm the Kid. The Kid carries two weapons, which may be selected from the choices available to the player at specific locations called arsenals. The Kid also has the ability to perform a special attack. Weapons and special attacks must be acquired before they can be used. There are a limited number of special attacks that the player can perform at any time, represented by ""black tonics"" that can be found in the levels or dropped from enemies. Special attacks may be used a total of three times. This maximum number of uses can be increased in the Distillery. The Kid's health is represented by a health bar, which can be replenished with ""health tonics"". Like black tonics, the Kid can only carry a certain number of health tonics at a time, and can replenish them by finding more in the levels.  Levels contain many different environment types, including cities, forests, and bogs. At the end of most levels, the player collects an item called a core or a shard; occasionally, the level begins to disintegrate once the Kid takes the item, forcing him to hastily retreat. As the player progresses through the levels, a voice narrates their actions. This narration gives scripted plot information as well as dynamic comments, such as on the player's skill with a weapon or performance while fighting enemies.  Between levels, the Kid visits the Bastion, where the player can use fragments—the game's form of currency—that they have accrued to buy materials and upgrade weapons. With each core the player collects, they can add one of six structures to the Bastion, such as a shrine, an armory, or a distillery, and each shard allows the player to expand a structure. Each structure serves a different purpose; for example, the distillery lets the player select upgrades, and the shrine allows the player to choose idols of the gods to invoke, causing the enemies to become stronger and giving the player increased experience points and currency. Experience points are used to determine the Kid's ability level; higher values give the player more health and increase the number of upgrades they can select.  Whenever the player leaves the Bastion, they can choose between one or two regular levels to play. In addition to these levels, however, the Kid can engage in challenge courses designed to test the player's skills with the weapons the player has found. They are called Proving Grounds. The challenges differ depending on the weapon, such as destroying a certain number of objects within a given time or breaking targets in the fewest shots possible. According to the player's score, different tiers of prizes are awarded. Additionally, the Kid can fight waves of enemies while the narrator tells a character's backstory by journeying to ""Who Knows Where"" from the Bastion. The back story battles occur during 'Memories.' The player earns fragments and experience for each completed wave. After the game is completed, the player can choose to begin a ""new game+"" mode, where the player replays through the game while keeping the experience points, fragments, and weapons that they have gained. This mode also offers more options in the buildings, as well as two more journeys to ""Who Knows Where"".   The game takes place in the aftermath of the Calamity, a catastrophic event that suddenly fractured the city of Caelondia (/seɪˈlɒndiə/) as well as the surrounding areas of the game's world into many floating pieces, disrupting its ecology and reducing most of its people to ash. Players take control of the Kid, a silent protagonist who awakens on one of the few remaining pieces of the old world and sets off for the eponymous Bastion, where everyone was supposed to go in troubled times. The only survivor he meets there is an elderly man named Rucks, the game's narrator, who instructs him to collect the Cores that once powered Caelondia. A device in the Bastion can use the power of the crystalline Cores to create landmasses and structures, as well as enable the Kid to travel farther afield via ""skyways"" that propel him through the air.  During his quest, the Kid meets two more survivors: Zulf, an ambassador from the Ura, underground-dwelling people with whom Caelondia was once at war; and Zia, an Ura girl who was raised in Caelondia. Both of them return to the Bastion, but upon reading a journal that the Kid discovers, Zulf intentionally damages parts of the Bastion's central device (the monument) and returns to Ura territory. The Kid learns that the journal belonged to Zia's father, Venn, who had worked for the Caelondians. He had helped Caelondian scientists (""Mancers"") build a weapon intended to destroy the Ura completely to prevent another war. Venn rigged the weapon to backfire, so that when he was finally forced to trigger it, the resulting Calamity destroyed most of Caelondia as well.  To repair Zulf's damage to the Bastion, the Kid starts collecting Shards, a lesser form of Cores. As he obtains the penultimate shard needed, the Ura attack the Bastion, damaging it and abducting Zia. In the next seven days, The Kid engages in sporadic skirmishes in Ura territory. When he finally blasts through an Ura outpost and meets Zia, she tells him that she had left with the Ura voluntarily to find out their intentions; Rucks had previously told Zia that the Bastion had the ability to somehow fix the Calamity. The Kid travels to the once-underground Ura homeland to retrieve the last shard. There, he discovers Zulf being attacked by his own people: the battle with the Kid has devastated the Ura forces, and they blame Zulf for bringing the Kid to their home. The Kid can choose to drop his weapon to help Zulf or leave him. If he leaves Zulf behind, the Kid destroys the remnants of the Ura and escapes through a skyway. If he chooses to carry Zulf, Ura archers initially open fire on them but ultimately cease fire and watch silently as the Kid and Zulf take the skyway back to the Bastion.  After the Kid returns and recovers, Rucks gives him another choice: He can have the Bastion rewind time to before the Calamity in the hopes of preventing it, or use it to evacuate the survivors and move on to somewhere safe. Rucks is unsure if there is any way to prevent the Calamity from reoccurring if the time is rewound, as there was no way to test the process. The game ends either way, showing images of the characters (with the inclusion of Zulf if the player chose to rescue him) flying away or of their lives before the Calamity along with the credits. In the New Game+ mode, which is unlocked after beating the game once, it is hinted that restoring the world didn't prevent the Calamity.  "

By using melee and long ranged attacks, complex combo strings, and multiple weapons, the game encourages to explore ways to dispatch angelic enemies with as much flair as possible. Special commands or actions are woven into events, finishes, executions, and unique ""Torture Attacks"" in which Bayonetta summons a variety of devices to deal devastating blows to her enemies. Such devices range from chainsaws to iron maidens. Bayonetta has unique but limited abilities that her enemies do not possess, such as ""Witch Time"", which activates when the player makes a well-timed dodge to an attack. This temporarily slows time to allow Bayonetta to inflict massive amounts of counter damage before the enemies can react.  The player can double jump for extra height, perform evasive backflips, and destroy background objects and doors. Camera views can be rotated, enemy targets can be locked on, and weapons can be switched during play. With unlockable transformations, the player can make Bayonetta become a panther or one of various other living creatures to enhance her abilities. Lollipops can be used to heal her, replenish her magic, induce invincibility or increase her strength, although using these items, as well as dying, lowers the score for that chapter. By finding various component items, the player can combine them into new items. Many enemies and objects drop halos when destroyed, which the player can use to buy items, techniques and weapon upgrades. The player can use enemy weapons, either to directly attack or as props for movement. Bayonetta's strongest attacks allow her to summon parts of Madama Butterfly and other demons with her hair. Bayonetta starts the game with four guns, two in her hands, two on her feet.

These can be customized to Bayonetta's arms and legs in various combinations.  The game consists of multiple chapters, each consisting of several verses. Depending on how well the player performs, they are given one of the following medals at the end of the verse; Stone, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum and Pure Platinum, similar to the rating system of Viewtiful Joe. There are some medals that are earned off the beaten path, such as special areas with set challenges. At the end of the chapter, a final score and an award are given depending on the type of medals achieved, with the score being deducted for any items used and deaths occurred.

Players are also able to use special moves called Torture Attacks, trapping opponents in infernal devices for extra points. Weapon customization from the first game also returns, allowing players to equip combinations of new weapons on both Bayonetta's hands and feet. A large array of weapons can be equipped, including the character's signature guns, a bow, swords and other forms of projectile weapons.

As with the previous game, Bayonetta can use Torture Attacks on her enemies, conjured torture devices that finish off single enemies in gruesome ways and grant a bonus to the player.  Bayonetta 2 adds a new gameplay element called Umbran Climax which can be activated when the player has a full magic gauge. Similar to the state of boss fights in the first game, this technique strengthens Bayonetta's attacks and combos with extra Wicked Weaves and Infernal Demon summons for a short period of time.

Players explore through a first-person view and have limited physical actions such as running and jumping. Different items can be collected, some of which are required to perform various tasks before proceeding. Cans of bacon soup, a reference to the game's creator theMeatly and his partner Mike Mood, can also be collected for achievements and to restore Henry's health if he is injured.  Combat is primarily focused around a variety of different melee-based weapons, such as an axe, pipe, plunger, or scythe. There are also long-range weapons such as a tommy gun or bacon soup cans. In-game enemies all have different strength levels and resilience to damage, forcing players to be tactical about keeping out of reach and striking when necessary. Failure to do so will result in a death. Henry can retreat inside Little Miracle Stations whenever enemies are nearby in order to recover or remain out of sight. If he takes too much damage, he can escape from the ink that consumes him and respawn at one of the numerous statues of Bendy that act as checkpoints.  In addition, players can find numerous audio logs throughout the studio that give more details about the game's story, particularly concerning the fate of the studio and its employees, similar to the systems used in games such as BioShock. Some of these logs can be missed and require further exploration to uncover the secret areas they often reside In.   Chapter 1: Moving Pictures  In August 1966, retired animator in his 50s, Henry Stein receives a letter from his former friend and employer, Joey Drew, asking him to return to their animation studio and see something important. He visits the now abandoned studio, but discovers an ""ink machine"", installed sometime after Henry's departure 30 years earlier. He finds a tape recording by janitor Wally Franks that suggests Joey engaged in bizarre occult practices while making the machine, as well as a mutilated real-life analogue of Boris the Wolf, one of the studio's cartoon characters. Once Henry fixes and starts the machine, he is attacked by a creature known as ""Ink Bendy"" that looks like an evil version of studio mascot Bendy.  As the studio begins to fill with ink, Henry flees toward the exit, only for the floor to collapse and drop him into the studio's lower levels. Draining the ink from this area, he finds a chamber whose floor is marked with strange diagrams. He hallucinates seeing the ink machine, a wheelchair, and then Ink Bendy before passing out.   Chapter 2: The Old Song  Henry wakes up and begins to search for a way out, eventually reaching the music department. Henry finds a stairwell leading to the exit, but the entrance is flooded with ink. While looking for a way to drain it, he is attacked by ink creatures known as the Searchers; once they are defeated, Henry enters the office of Sammy Lawrence, the studio's musical director. After completing several tasks to drain the ink, Henry hurries toward the exit but is attacked by Sammy, whose body has been transformed into ink. Sammy intends to sacrifice Henry to Ink Bendy in order to become a human again, but before he can do so, he is dragged away by Ink Bendy and presumably killed. Henry frees himself and flees through the studio, pursued by Ink Bendy. Barricading himself behind a door, he waits until Ink Bendy has left and then meets a living, intact Boris, called Buddy Boris.   Chapter 3: Rise And Fall  Henry befriends Buddy Boris, and the two leave the latter's safehouse to continue searching for an exit. In the toy department, they find another ink creature called Twisted Alice, who is a distorted version of actress Susie Campbell and the good character Alice Angel. Twisted Alice leads them to her lair and reveals that she has been harvesting the ink of other characters in order to make herself beautiful. Henry must perform several tasks for Twisted Alice in order for her to let him and Buddy Boris go free, learning from tape recordings that Susie Campbell became bitter when Joey suddenly hired a replacement for her, called Allison Pendle. Because of Joey not telling Susie that he replaced her with Allison Pendle, and the latter doing to do the voice acting of Alice Angel, the ink transformed Susie Campbell into Twisted Alice. As Henry carries out Twisted Alice's tasks, he must hide from both Ink Bendy and the Projectionist, an entity of projector operator Norman Polk. Henry completes the tasks and boards a lift to escape with Buddy Boris, but Twisted Alice forces it to crash to the bottom of its shaft and suddenly pulls Buddy Boris into the darkness.   Chapter 4: Colossal Wonders  Climbing out of the crashed lift, Henry ventures deeper into the studio in search of Buddy Boris and finds a lounge filled with the Lost Ones, ink creatures who show no hostility. He also discovers that Joey had been planning to open a Bendy-themed amusement park called Bendy Land with the help of famed ride designer Bertrum Piedmont. Henry enters a large warehouse filled with rides, games, and props from the planned park. In order to reach Buddy Boris, Henry must restore power to the haunted house attraction by finding and flipping a series of switches, which requires Henry to do a series of challenges. Upon restoring the power, Henry meets Buddy Boris, but as a twisted version of him called Brute Boris. Twisted Alice orders Brute Boris to kill Henry. Henry tries to kill him, and when he does, it frees Buddy Boris' ghost. Twisted Alice then tries to kill Henry herself but is killed with a sword from behind by Allison Angel, a physically intact and sane duplicate of Alice Angel and reincarnation of Susie's replacement, Allison Pendle. She is accompanied by Tom, a reincarnation of worker Thomas Connor as a wolf character similar to Boris.  Chapter 5: The Last Reel  Allison and Tom hold Henry captive, but he eventually gains Allison's trust and she gives him a ""seeing tool"" that allows him to see hidden messages on the walls. After Tom inadvertently reveals the location of their hideout to Ink Bendy, he and Allison abandon Henry and flee. Henry escapes on his own and crosses a river of ink on a paddleboat, reaching a shantytown built by the Lost Ones. There, Henry is attacked by Sammy, shown to still be alive and blaming Henry for Ink Bendy's decision to abandon him. Unmasked by Henry, Sammy tries to kill him, only for Tom to kill him instead. After Tom gains Henry's trust, Tom and Allison aid Henry in fighting off the Searchers and Lost Ones, revealed Sammy kept them at bay, and Henry falls into the administration hallways. After completing a puzzle, Henry finds Tom and Allison. Henry learns that Ink Bendy has stolen something important from the film vault and enters his lair — a much vaster version of the ink machine — to retrieve it. Allison and Tom remain behind, fearing that the ink will absorb and corrupt them. Inside, Henry finds one last tape recording by Joey, expressing his regret for everything that has happened and asking Henry to destroy Bendy. Henry finds the stolen item, a film reel marked ""The End."" Ink Bendy chases him throughout the machine while transforming into a giant beast, called Beast Bendy. Henry eventually plays the reel, projecting a ""The End"" title card on every available screen and causing Beast Bendy to disintegrate when he sees it.  The game suddenly changes to a flashback in the inside of Joey's home, with a bulletin board covered with letters from Allison Pendle, now married to Thomas Connor, and Wally Franks as well as sketches such as Bendy Land. Entering the kitchen, Henry finds Joey waiting to talk to him about the paths they took in their lives. After Joey tells to Henry visit the studio, Henry exits the house and finds himself immediately entering it, repeating his opening lines from Chapter 1. It is presumed that Henry and all of the studio's employees, now ink monsters and ink characters are trapped in a time loop of unknown origin.  In a post-credits scene, the camera focuses on a framed portrait of Bendy, Boris and Alice, which was a gift from Henry to congratulate Joey for his success (alongside a rusty ink machine sitting in one corner of the room). Just then, a little girl's voice asks ""Uncle Joey"" to tell her another story, implying that the entire game was merely a story Joey was telling his niece.  "

102,Big Pharma,/wiki/Big_Pharma_(video_game),Puzzle,Nussoft,Klabater,Unreleased,"December 5, 2019","December 5, 2019","Game mechanics  In Big Pharma the player takes the role as the manager of a pharmaceutical company, producing prescription drugs from raw materials. Raw materials have intrinsic positive (e.g., ""Reduces coughs"") and negative (e.g., ""Induces drowsiness"") effects that present themselves when the material is within a set concentration range, with possible concentrations ranging on a 0-to-20 scale. Most of the positive benefits can be enhanced to more desirable effects, or negative side effects can be outright removed, by bringing the material to a specific concentration range and applying an indicated process, some further requiring the addition of a catalyst material which itself carries positive and negative effects. Materials can also be mixed to combine positive and negative benefits to create more potent drugs. The goal in the mixing and preparation of materials is to achieve drugs that have their positive effects as close to their maximum potency concentration while either eliminating side effects or bringing the material's concentration as far away from the side effects' maximum potency levels.   The player produces the drugs using an assembly line approach with various equipment that can modify the concentration of the material, combine materials, rearrange the effects of a material to determine how effects combine when mixed, analyze materials to determine maximum potency levels, and finally prepare the material in pill form for delivery. This is done on an isometric view of building plant floorplan, with various ports along the edges that can be used to bring in materials or ship out completed drugs. Materials are transported via conveyor belts between the processing units. Added building space can be purchased with in-game funds. The player can click on processes or materials to evaluate their current state, thus giving them the ability to debug the production line. Once the player has produced a complete pill from specific materials for the first time and delivered it to an output port, they are given the opportunity to name the product. This product is then sold on the game's virtual market. The produce is rated on a letter-grade based on the effectiveness and lack of side-effects as well as current market demand. The production lines operate in real-time - in that while the player can pause the game to arrange equipment within a production line, the game while running tracks the movement of each unit of material through the production line and only considered each unit as a product when it reaches the end of the production line.  In the larger game, the player must build up these drug production lines to maintain a profit and allow them to build additional lines. Scenarios in the game include competing companies that will also be releasing prescription drugs that will impact the profitability of the player's products. For example, if other companies have released a cold remedy drug, the market may be too saturated for a better cold remedy to succeed. The player can review what market demand there is for specific remedies to tailor productions toward those goals. In addition, the player can manage a research tree that enables more effective process equipment and other benefits to be built, and send out explorers to research on new possible ingredients to build from. The game includes a number of preset scenarios (such as reached a financial milestone after a number of years of operation) at various difficulty levels as well as the ability to create a custom open-ended game.  An expansion, ""Marketing And Malpractice"", was released on 26 April 2016. This expansion will add Executives as part of the company which can be used to market the drugs produced by the player's production lines, as well as to try to manipulate and corner the market.  "
104,BioShock,/wiki/BioShock,First-person shooter,Blind Squirrel Games,2K Games,"May 29, 2020","May 29, 2020","May 29, 2020"," BioShock is a first-person shooter with role-playing game customization and stealth elements, and is similar to System Shock 2. The player takes the role of Jack as he is guided through Rapture towards various objectives. The player collects multiple weapons and plasmids as they work their way through enemy forces. The player can switch between one active weapon and one active plasmid at any time, allowing them to find combination attacks that can be effective against certain enemies, such as first shocking a Splicer then striking them down with a wrench. Weapons are limited by ammunition that the player collects; many weapons have secondary ammo types that can be used instead for additional benefits, such as bullets that inflict fire damage. Plasmid use consumes a serum called EVE which can be restored using EVE syringes collected by the player. The player has a health meter that decreases when they take damage. The player can restore their health with medical packs found throughout Rapture. If the player's health reduces to zero, they will be regenerated at the last Vita-Chamber that they passed with limited amounts of health and EVE. A patch for the game allows players to disable these Vita-Chambers, requiring players to restart a saved game if the character dies.  The game provides several options for players to face challenges. In addition to direct combat, the player can use plasmids to lure enemies into traps or to turn enemies against each other, or employ stealth tactics to avoid detection by hostiles including the security systems and turrets. The player can hack into any of Rapture's automated systems; the hacking process is done via a mini-game similar to Pipe Mania where the player must connect two points on opposite sides of a grid with a limited set of piping within a fixed amount of time, with failure to complete in time costing health and potentially sounding alarms. Early in the game, the player is given a research camera; by taking photographs of enemies, the player will cumulatively gain knowledge about the individual foes which translates into attack boosts and other benefits when facing that enemy type in the future.  The player collects money by exploring Rapture and from the bodies of defeated foes; this money can be used at vending machines to restock on ammunition, health and EVE, and other items; like security cameras, vending machines can also be hacked to reduce the costs of items from it. The player will also receive rewards in the form of ADAM from completing some tasks, as well as from either saving or killing the Little Sisters after defeating their Big Daddy guardian. ADAM is used to purchase new plasmids from Gatherer's Garden machines scattered around Rapture. In addition to plasmids, the player will also collect and buy tonics that provide passive bonuses, such as increasing Jack's strength, using EVE more efficiently, or making Jack more resistant to damage. The player can only have a limited number of plasmids and tonics active at any time, and can swap between the various plasmids and tonics at certain stations located throughout Rapture.  "
105,BioShock 2,/wiki/BioShock_2,First-person shooter,Blind Squirrel Games,2K Games,"May 29, 2020","May 29, 2020","May 29, 2020"," BioShock 2 is a first-person shooter, with the player taking on the role of Subject Delta eight years after the events of the first BioShock game. As in BioShock, the player explores Rapture and fights off Splicers using a combination of weapons, the environment, and plasmids. Plasmids function akin to magic and much be recharged with ""EVE"" to be used. The player can also equip ""tonics"", passive bonuses that range from increased speed to reduced EVE usage. Several of the weapons in BioShock 2 were previously seen carried by Big Daddies in the first game, including a powerful drill and a rivet gun. The player can use each weapon in a close-range melee attack, unlike in the first game, and is able to equip a weapon and a plasmid at the same time, which they can use in quick succession to destroy enemies. For example, the player might freeze a foe using a plasmid then shatter it using a spear gun. If the player is killed, they are revived via ""vita-chambers.""  As the player explores Rapture, he will collect ammo, health, recovery items, money and EVE (a liquid used to power plasmid use). Money can be used to purchase more items at vending machines scattered around the city. The player will also encounter security systems which can be hacked through a mini-game; this requires the player to stop a quick-moving needle one or more times in the correctly colored areas of a gauge. Stopping it within a green area progresses the sequence or potentially ends it; stopping in a blue area may grant a bonus to the hacking result, landing in a white area shocks the player (dealing a small amount of damage); and landing in a red area causes a security alert. The player also gains access to a research video camera. In BioShock 2, once the player begins recording an enemy, the player has a short time to damage that enemy in creative ways in order to score a number of points, which are then added towards the total research points of that enemy type.  As a Big Daddy, the player can defeat other Big Daddies and either adopt their Little Sisters, having them gather ADAM for the player, or harvest them for their ADAM outright. If the player adopts the Little Sister, they escort their charge to corpses littered around Rapture and protect them while they harvest more ADAM. Once the Little Sister has collected enough ADAM, the player can choose to harvest or save her. Harvesting or saving Little Sisters will provoke attacks from armored Big Sisters. ADAM can be used to upgrade the player's plasmids and tonics.  "
106,BioShock Infinite,/wiki/BioShock_Infinite,First-person shooter,Blind Squirrel Games,2K Games,"May 29, 2020","May 29, 2020","May 29, 2020"," Like BioShock and BioShock 2, BioShock Infinite is a first-person shooter with role-playing elements. In contrast to the limited spaces of Rapture in previous BioShock games, the expanded environment of Columbia provides for more dynamic combat challenges in Infinite. As Booker, the player must fight their way through Columbia using weapons and a variety of tools in order to complete objectives. The player may carry only two weapons at a time, and can collect other weapons and ammunition either from defeated enemies or from random locations around the city. In addition to his health, Booker is also equipped with a shield. When damaged, the shield regenerates after a few seconds, while health can be replenished with medical kits or food. Should Booker die, the player revives in a safe area but loses a slight amount of money; Booker regains partial health and is granted additional ammunition, while local enemies are also partially healed. Players can still recover from death should they lose all their money.  Booker gains powers and abilities through Vigors, Gears, and Infusions, all scattered around Columbia. Vigors, the equivalent of BioShock's Plasmids, grant activated powers such as creating shockwaves, releasing bolts of electricity, and machine/human possession. Vigors require Salt, the equivalent of magic points or BioShock's EVE, for powering their abilities. Salts can be found throughout Columbia, and are also granted upon death. Wearing Gears grant passive abilities that can improve the player's strength or damage resistance, similar in function to BioShock's Tonics. Each piece of Gear attaches to one of four specific slots: Hats, Shirts, Boots, and Pants. Only one piece of Gear can be affixed to a slot at a time; any extra Gear is stored in the player's inventory. Infusions grant the ability to permanently boost the player's health, Salts or shield meter by one stat; they also fully restore whatever is being boosted.  At certain points throughout the story, the player will be forced to make a choice in order to continue, each choice making minor changes on the story. For example, at a raffle at the start of the game, Booker wins and the raffle is revealed to be a front for a public stoning of an interracial couple. As a reward for winning the raffle, Booker is given the very first throw, and the player is given a choice to throw at the couple or at the announcer. If the player chooses the latter option, the couple appears later to thank him for sparing them, but if the player chooses the former option, the announcer congratulates him later in the game.  Booker can traverse Columbia both on foot and by riding the ""Sky-Line."" The Sky-Line is a roller coaster-like rail-based system — originally designed for moving cargo around Columbia but later used for personal transport — whereupon the player activates a wrist-mounted tool — called the Sky-Hook — that Booker and enemies wear to jump and hang onto the self-powered tracks. The player can jump onto, off of, and between Sky-Line tracks at any time, and may face enemies that use the system to attack; the player can use one-handed weapons in Booker's free hand while using the Sky-Line. Freedom of movement along the Sky-Line allows for several varieties of combat, including flanking, cover, and area-of-effect attacks through creative uses of the system. Booker can also dive off from the Sky-Line to strike enemies with his Sky-Hook; while on the ground, he can melee and execute enemies with it.  Once reunited with Elizabeth, the player must work with her to escape Columbia. The player does not directly control Elizabeth, but instead she reacts to the player and the current situation in a manner similar to the AI Director in Left 4 Dead. Unlike BioShock, where the player is tasked with protecting a Little Sister while escorting her, Elizabeth requires no protection and can take care of herself in combat. While the player is in battle, Elizabeth scavenges the area for supplies such as ammunition, medical kits, Salts, and other items, and tosses them to Booker as needed. She can also use her Tear-opening powers to aid the player, bringing in weapons, health, Salts, environmental features such as cover or a ledge for higher ground, and automated defense units. Only one Tear can be opened at a time, making the player decide between the available options to suit the battle. Elizabeth also has the ability to pick locks using her hairpin. However, she requires ""one-use"" lockpicks, found all over Columbia, to open doors or safes storing valuable or hidden items.  While exploring Columbia, the player and Elizabeth can find various useful items such as cash, food, medical kits, ammunition and Salts. Vending machines, present throughout Columbia, can be used to buy supplies, and powerful upgrades for weapons and Vigors. Optional side-missions are also available, where the player must unlock safes or decode hidden ciphers; completing them rewards Booker with a handful of supplies, Voxophones and Infusion upgrades.  As the player progresses through the city, he is opposed by various enemies, classified into three types: Standard Enemies, Heavy Hitters and Basic Security Automata. Standard Enemies are regular foes consisting of several different human forces representing the Founders and the Vox Populi. Heavy Hitters are more formidable enemies, aligned with the Founders, who act as mini-bosses throughout the game, demanding new tactics from the player. They consist of: the Vigor-powered Fireman and Zealot of the Lady, the heavily armored Beast, the powerful robotic-like monster Handyman, the crank gun-wielding automaton Motorized Patriot, and the enemy-detecting Boys of Silence. The Vox Populi also possess their own versions of the Fireman, Beast and Motorized Patriot. Basic Security Automata are armed machines scattered throughout Columbia that act as a security defense system for the city, consisting of the fixed Gun and Rocket Automatons, and the flying Mosquito.  After completing the story mode on Easy, Normal, or Hard difficulties, a ""1999 Mode"" is unlocked, where the challenge of the game is significantly increased. Enemies are much tougher, the player's navigational aid and aim assist is removed, and resource management is much more crucial to survival; also, the difficulty of the game cannot be changed while playing. Additionally, in this mode, reviving after dying uses up more money; should Booker die with less than $100, the game ends, and the player is sent back to the main menu and has to resume from their last autosave prior to the section where they died. Alternatively, 1999 Mode can simply be unlocked by inputting a secret code — the Konami Code — in the main menu. The mode is a callback to System Shock 2, a video game developed by Irrational Games, released in 1999.  "
107,Bite the Bullet,/wiki/Bite_the_Bullet_(video_game),Role-playing,Mega Cat Studios,Graffiti Games,Unreleased,2020,2020," Bite the Bullet is platform game in which players control a mercenary- either Chewie or Chewella. As the player progresses through the game, they're given the option to upgrade their character's health and gain abilities, such as the ability to freeze attacking enemies, via a skill tree. During a level, players can either destroy enemies outright with their weapons, or they can deal enough damage to render enemies stunned and then, while they're in a stunned state, eat them. Consuming enemies in the game adds fat, calories and protein to the player; the more fat a player a player consumes, the slower they become. If players consume enemies or items which are ""rotten"", the game enters a ""gut-crafting"" mode, in which players are given the opportunity to modify and enhance their weapons using calories, protein and fat picked up from consuming enemies, but will lose calories whether or not they modify anything.  Enemies will sometimes drop weapons with unique modifiers, such as the ability to draw enemies closer when they're struck. Each level in the game features a different setting. After consuming enough enemies, players can enter ""Zombro"" mode in which they lose access to their weapons while invulnerability, speed, jump height, and the ability to melee attack enemies.  As the game progresses, the player can choose a character class, determining what abilities they'll gain, and which enemies they can consume, from that point forward.   Bite the Bullet takes place in a futuristic, dystopic setting; mankind suffered a food crisis that resulted in the invention of ""bionodes,"" implants that enabled humans to consume inorganic matter, but also resulted in mutations. The mutated humans, dubbed ghouls, were left behind on Earth as the rest of humanity colonized other planets in an event known as the Great Exodus.  The game follows a mercenary (Chewie/Chewella) tasked with collecting DNA from Earth's ghouls by eating them. Collected ghoul DNA becomes part of the Compendium, a database of the galaxy's species. The player's employer, Vora, is the CEO of the DarwinCorp, the megacorporation that runs the Compendium and assigns the player missions.  The game opens with the player being introduced to Joachim, who invites Chewie/Chewella to the teleporter room for the game's tutorial- it is through the teleporter room that players access subsequent levels.

The game avoids the use of more complex directional inputs seen in other fighting games; instead, players perform various attacks and special moves by pressing a single directional input in combination with one or more of the four attack buttons, similar to the Super Smash Bros. series. During battle, players can build their super meter by dealing or receiving damage, which can be used to enhance their special moves or perform powerful super attacks. When a player character's health depletes below a certain level, the player is able to activate a temporary ""Heat Up!"" state. This can only be used once per round for a short time, and will increase the player character's attack speed while preventing opponents from interrupting the player's attacks.  Blade Strangers offers a single-player story mode, with characters interacting with one another while progressing through a tournament ladder, along with arcade, survival, training and challenge modes. The game also supports local and online multiplayer battles.    In the world of Blade Strangers, every universe is one of many simulations being generated by an interdimensional network of servers. These simulations are overseen by the goddess Exiva and her Motes, a group of sentient computers, and protected by their champions, the Blade Strangers. A cybernetic being known as Lina appears and begins consuming the servers' data, wiping out whole worlds and defeating all of the Blade Strangers. To protect the universe, the motes summon heroes from worlds Lina has not yet reached, altering their memories to make them believe they are participating in a fighting tournament.

114,Blair Witch,/wiki/Blair_Witch_(video_game),Survival horror,Bloober Team,JP,"July 9, 2020","June 25, 2020","June 25, 2020"," As with previous Bloober Team games, Blair Witch is a first-person survival horror game and is a single player campaign. The player controls former police officer and veteran Ellis Lynch who joins a search party for a missing boy in the Black Hills forest in Burkittsville, Maryland.   The game plays out in a semi-open world, making players explore different parts of the areas which can sometimes lead to abandoned structures, campsites or little crevices that only Bullet can access. Along the way, they will find items such as wooden dolls, polaroids of missing people, dog tags and psychiatrist notes which are stored in the backpack. Also stored in the backpack are dog treats which can be fed to Bullet. Sometimes, areas can be blocked off by a log or a door and are only accessible by solving a puzzle or by collecting several items that opens or operates for example, a steam donkey. It may also require the player to find cassette tapes. There are two types; red and blue. The red tape allows players to manipulate and rewind time to move objects that have been locked or moved in place, while the blue tape tells more of the story. These tapes can be accessed via the camcorder.  While in the forest, Ellis will reminisce about his past through the use of several devices; a cell phone and a walkie-talkie. Whenever a call is received, the player can choose to accept or reject. This decision chosen will directly affect the game's conclusion as well. Messages and voicemails will also pop up occasionally, players can access them in the menu. Also in the phone's menu are the popular 2D games Snake and Astro Blaster which can be played at any point of the playthrough.  A major element of gameplay is Ellis' dog, Bullet. The player is able to interact with the dog through a command menu. There are five commands, ""Stay"", ""Stay close"", ""Reprimand, ""Pet"" and ""Seek"". The latter serves as an integral part of gameplay, as items found throughout allow Bullet to track the scent of certain objects or the general direction of where to go. During combat, Bullet serves as an indicator when shadowy creatures attack the player and will bark when they are close by, the player can fend for themselves by shining their flashlight towards the creatures.  Another feature with Bullet, is the psychological state of Ellis. It is crucial for the player to keep Bullet close to them at all times, as being separated from him for some time can affect the state of the character. The game's ending is dependent on the relationship between the player and the dog, accounting for the actions the player has done.  The game roughly takes up to six hours to complete, with a possibility of four endings and an additional secret ending.   The game is set in 1996, two years after the events of the first film, Ellis Lynch (voiced by Joseph May), a former police officer and a veteran, travels to the Black Hills Forest to join the search party for a missing boy, nine-year old Peter Shannon. He brings with him his pet dog, Bullet. While driving towards the Forest, he receives a call from his ex-wife, Jess. When he arrives at the forest, he takes his flashlight, acquires a Walkie-Talkie, and begins his search. Shortly after entering the forest, Ellis decides that he should call Sheriff Lanning, who is also on the search for the missing child. Lanning questions Ellis on whether he is in the condition to join the search.  After communicating with Lanning, Ellis ventures with Bullet through a small area of the forest in day time. Ellis finds a hat from which Bullet is able to follow Peter's scent. As the sky gets darker, Ellis and Bullet make their way through the forest, eventually reaching a campsite. Ellis discovers a camcorder placed on a rock; he picks the camcorder up and checks it, before blacking out. Ellis begins to dream, recalling previous points in his life. When Ellis finally awakens, it is shown that he had fallen asleep in the tent and it has gotten significantly darker outside.  Ellis remembers the camcorder from before he blacked out and happens upon a red tape. Ellis begins to view the tape and realizes that he can make certain objects from the tape appear or move in reality. Ellis successfully rewinds the red tape and a small toy police car appears on the ground. Shortly after, Lanning calls Ellis. Ellis begins trying to explain the red tape and what happened, but Lanning reveals that they didn't find such a campsite. Lanning tells Ellis to stay where he is so they can all meet up and follow Bullet. Ellis tells him that he can't wait for them to catch up and disconnects.  Ellis and Bullet eventually arrive at a crooked tree with black vines and white branches. They are unexpectedly stalked and attacked by several silhouetted monsters shrouded in leaves and twigs, with Bullet aiding Ellis as he scares them off with his flashlight. Ellis and Bullet begin searching the surrounding area. Ellis finds what looks to be war trenches and a broken down vehicle. As he searches the vehicle, he finds a red tape which shows that Peter was abducted. As Ellis and Bullet are heading back to find another route, the broken-down truck from before is now Lanning's truck. Ellis gets in the truck and switches on the headlights. A bright flash envelopes everything around Ellis and he steps out of the truck to find that it seems to be the next morning.  Continuing on his search, Bullet finds a pile of leaves and branches and begins digging and whimpering. Ellis discovers Lanning's body, and a tape showing that Lanning was murdered by Peter's abductor. Ellis follows Bullet back the way they came only to find that the river they crossed is now dried up. While walking across the river, Bullet begins to sniff at something, an old soldier's helmet. Ellis begins examining it and is told to run. While running, Ellis hears gunshots and dogs barking and sees flashes of light are coming from all around them until they come to a very large tree with an opening in the trunk. Ellis begins to follow Bullet through the tree hearing a voice saying ""Come to me, Ellis."" He finally gets to an opening, but he falls down and begins to crawl until he passes out again and begins dreaming.  The nightmare shows that Ellis, as an officer, shot Peter's brother while responding to a robbery call, severely injuring him; he becomes obsessed with saving Peter as a means of amending that. Awakening, he finds himself in front of the campsite, which seems far more older and overgrown. He inexplicably finds various dog tags belonging to his team. Using Bullet and his camera he finds a patch belonging to the lumber mill, where Lanning was investigating.  On the way there, Ellis finds a burning part of the forest filled with rubble and remains of buildings reminiscent of the site of his failed mission, avoiding a strange force digging through the piles of leaves. He suffers a powerful hallucination of how he felt responsible for the death of his military squad, who were killed during a mission. Arriving at the mills' outpost, he uses the recorder to restart the boiler to power a mine cart. The two ride it as the leaf-dwelling creature follows. Crossing a bridge, Ellis calls Jess one more time before connection is lost, where he alludes to the strange happenings of the woods. She insists he return, but he refuses.  At the mill, he investigates to find the partially bisected corpse of a worker, who was murdered with the equipment by the kidnapper. He comes face to face with the man himself, a mysterious man named Carver, who asks if he sees ""her"". He accuses Ellis of being weak, knocking him out while stating that Peter must die, such is ""her"" will. After another flashback, he awakens as Carver brings him back near the camp, who tells him he was like him, weak and pathetic, but found new purpose, saying he was set free the moment he started listening. Grabbing his recorder, he sees that it shows invisible painted marks around him. He finds the camp is now completely decayed, and gets radio messages from Carver; Ellis gives one final message to Jess. He uses the camera to find the white tree, which he removes several twigs, finding that the tree ""bleeds"" a strange black sap. Using the skin of a deer Carver killed, he makes the sign of the witch. The scent leads Bullet to a small opening under a tree, but a screech is followed as he runs out in fright. Carver tells him of how the only way to survive is to submit, and leads him to a gun to kill Bullet with but Ellis refuses. When Bullet runs off, he's later found wounded. Ellis carries him, only to find himself in a loop with many messages telling him to give it up.  Ellis passes out to find Bullet missing, with voices whispering to him. Attacked by a mysterious creature, he wakes in a cave made of branches, using his flashlight to scare off apparitions. Waking and passing out again, he's confronted by Carver, who mocks him, revealing that he killed Bullet, stating that it's time. He wakes up at the campsite once more, this time in a rainstorm and a very different location. He sees and enters a house, following clues leading to the basement, finding the house seemingly filled with multiple passages and doorways. He has more visions of his past, revealing that the deaths of his comrades due to his negligence was caused by his shock and guilt of incidentally causing the death of a native girl while hiding from enemy forces, resulting in him not noticing their approach and therefore not warning them of the danger; the concealed face he's seen throughout was hers.  Ellis goes through the halls, with the voice's presence becoming more unbearable, all while he avoids shining the light at a monster that becomes enraged when illuminated. At some point, he's thrown into a rage, aggressively making his way into the basement, much to his confusion. Entering it, he finds Peter is nowhere, and goes through a secret trapdoor to the outside. Depending on the ending, he either kills Carver, or lets him kill him, refusing to allow the presence to take him over as a weakened Carver dies anyway. Bullet is revealed to be alive, and the ending depends on how well he's treated. If he ends up killing Carver, he suddenly finds he has transformed into him; Bullet leaves the forest either in fear or sadness. If he lets Carver kill him, Bullet either moves on or stays by his side.  The ending cutscene varies and depends on players completing certain requirements; the endings can either reveal that Lanning's body was never found or was recovered and buried with top honors, the lumberer Todd Mackinnon was found nearly beyond identification or recovered by his family to be buried, and Peter's fate can be unknown or revealed that he was ultimately murdered at Carver's hands or safely found by the authorities and returned to his family unscathed.

In a distant future, earth falls into an ice age, after countless wars and environmental disasters. Due to the ice age, the human race was forced to live underground. When the ice age came to an end, humanity began making methods they learned while living underground to restore the planet and the environment. During that time, a large, mysterious comet fell to the earth, but that did not hinder their effort to restore the lost ecosystems, and humans were able to live on the earth's surface once again.   Several hundred years later, Jason Frudnick, a young genius in the field of robotics, finds an unusual-looking and frog-like creature that he names Fred. His research is interrupted when Fred escapes into a wormhole that seemed to appear from nowhere, and Jason finds himself inside one of the underground environments from the past, where he encounters an armored tank named SOPHIA III, which he proceeds to use in order to fend off against the mutants that suddenly took over the underground and locate Fred.  During his quest, Jason finds an unconscious girl named Eve, who has a strange connection to SOPHIA III. Together, they find and rescue Fred, whereupon Jason finds out that both Eve and Fred are actually aliens.

Like Castlevania III, the game features stages with branching paths that lead to a single boss, and multiple playable characters. The player starts as swordsman Zangetsu, and may recruit up to three other characters as they progress including the whip-wielding Miriam, a magician named Alfred, and a vampire named Gebel. Each character has different weapons, skills, health points, and attack styles that make them more appropriate for different situations. The player may switch between these characters instantly at any time. If a character dies, they become unavailable for the rest of the level, which may limit the player's ability to explore the remainder of the stage or potentially even complete it. In such instances, the player can restart the level with all characters again. The player has the ability to enable and disable unlimited lives and the player character is knocked back when hit by an enemy, characteristic of classic Castlevania gameplay. There is also a boss rush mode, and other options to increase game difficulty.   The story follows Zangetsu, a swordsman searching for revenge upon the demons who magically cursed him. He feels the presence of a great demon, and swears to kill all demons he can find as he quests across the areas of Curse of the Moon.  During his search he encounters Miriam, Alfred, and Gebel. Based on how the protagonist treats the other travelers, the ending changes. In all paths, he fights the archdemon Gremory in the final stage. If Zangetsu allies with all three potential party members, Gremory's final attack on the party is blocked by him, who absorbs the dark power and becomes corrupted. Miriam, Alfred, and Gebel manage to escape the castle, but are not able to forget about Zangetsu who was left behind. If the protagonist ignores all three potential party members and travels alone, then the three of them arrive to block Gremory's final attack, sacrificing themselves and saving the main character. If Zangetsu mixes recruiting, ignoring, and killing the others, then he (and any allies) will leave the castle and watch as it crumbles with the sunrise, but the swordsman is not freed from his curse. If Zangetsu chooses to kill the other three and absorb their power he will absorb Gremory's dark energy attack and become the new dark emperor.  In ""Nightmare"" mode, unlocked if the player defeats the game while recruiting all three potential allies, Miriam, Alfred, and Gebel travel back to the castle to defeat the corrupted Zangetsu, who is that mode's final enemy. The three kill the emperor and free his soul from the curse of the moon.  "
125,Bloodstained Ritual of the Night,/wiki/Bloodstained_Ritual_of_the_Night,Metroidvania,ArtPlay,505 Games,"October 24, 2019","June 25, 2019","June 25, 2019"," Bloodstained takes place in 18th century England during the Industrial Revolution. Fearing the loss of their influence over their wealthy patrons, the Alchemy Guild researched methods to summon demons and created Shardbinders, humans forcibly fused with demonically-charged crystals that attuned them to their powers. These Shardbinders were sacrificed by the Guild to summon demons from Hell in what was meant to be a scare tactic but instead brought uncontrollable destruction that wiped out the Guild and much of England until the Church was able to banish them. Of the sacrificed Shardbinders, only one named Gebel survived. Another Shardbinder, the main protagonist Miriam, is spared due to falling into an unnatural slumber before she can be sacrificed.  Ten years later in the game's present-day, Miriam has awakened from her slumber and has learned that Gebel has summoned the demons to destroy England as he seeks revenge on the surviving alchemists for what they did to him. Accompanied by Johannes, a former member of the Alchemy Guild, they sail across the ocean to Arvantville, a destroyed village on the outskirts of Gebel's castle, the Hellhold. They meet with Johannes's friend Dominique, an exorcist who helped Johannes care for Miriam during her slumber and has been sent by the Church to help them stop Gebel.  As Miriam begins her journey into the Hellhold, she confronts Alfred, a surviving member of the Alchemy Guild and the former mentor to Johannes. Alfred seeks to recover an ancient book used in the demon summoning by Gebel, the Liber Logaeth, and threatens to kill Miriam if she does not leave. As his former student, Johannes deeply distrusts Alfred's motives and fears he may be making another mistake, partially feeling responsible for the actions that Alfred and the other alchemists took in harming Gebel, Miriam, and the other Shardbinders. She also crosses paths multiple times with Zangetsu, a demon hunter from the Far East who initially distrusts Miriam due to her Shardbinder powers having ties to demons, but over time begins to respect her strength. Zangetsu explains that he is seeking a demon named Gremory, who is continuously eluding him for fear of his power. He gives Miriam his katana thinking that Gremory will not expect her to be wielding it and drop her guard.  Miriam confronts Gebel in the Hellhold's throne room, and she attempts to reason with him by reminding him that during the trauma of her transformation into a Shardbinder, he was the one who taught her to never give up on her humanity. Though he briefly seems moved by her words, Gebel remains defiant and the two Shardbinders fight. Should Gebel be killed, he will thank Miriam for stopping him, but the game will immediately end as Miriam wonders if she made the right choice. Using Zangetsu's katana, Miriam instead exposes Gremory's hiding place in the throne room and she escapes. Freed from the demon's control, Gebel is only able to give Miriam his final apologies before the crystals in his body consume him completely. Alfred then arrives to steal the Liber Logaeth from them and flees.  Miriam chases Gremory and Alfred through a dimensional portal into another part of the castle. Inside, she finds Alfred mortally wounded and the Liber Logaeth gone. As he dies, he explains that he was trying to use the Liber Logaeth as part of a spell he had cast throughout the Hellhold to destroy it. He also reveals that he was the one who put Miriam in her slumber ten years ago to sabotage the Guild's summoning, knowing her power as a Shardbinder was so immense that it would have brought even worse destruction than what was summoned had she been sacrificed.  Reuniting with Zangetsu, Miriam tracks down Gremory. Zangetsu uses his power to bind the demon in place, but he is seemingly killed in the process and so Miriam defeats Gremory alone. She then locates the Liber Logaeth and the one who stole it: Dominique. Craving the power to defy and destroy God for letting everybody die during the demon summoning ten years ago, Dominique reveals that she has turned herself into a Shardbinder through extensive study of Miriam and Gebel and uses the Liber Logaeth to summon Bael, the king of demons. Miriam banishes Dominique and Bael, and Johannes uses the Liber Logaeth to complete Alfred's spell and destroy the Hellhold.  As peace returns to the land, Miriam mourns the sacrifices made for her victory and wonders if the world will ever truly be free of the demons. Johannes consoles Miriam by revealing that with the Liber Logaeth, he may have the means to permanently stop the crystals from consuming her body. Miriam and Johannes leave Arvantville while an unseen person's shadow steps into view, revealed to be Zangetsu who survived the events of the story after managing to escape hell. He retrieves his sword, Zangetsuto, after watching the pair walk away.   The game follows the post-Metroidvania-style gameplay of the Symphony of the Night and Order of Ecclesia games of the Castlevania series. As Miriam, the player explores a labyrinthine series of rooms presented as a platform game, fighting monsters and bosses and gaining keys or powers that let them explore previous areas that were previously impossible to reach. Miriam is able to use various weapons to perform melee or ranged attacks to defeat monsters, or special abilities granted by the shards she possesses from monsters to perform magical attacks. Miriam has both a health bar and a magic power bar. Health is lost to monster and environmental attacks, and should this drop to zero, the game is over, requiring the player to load the last save state. Health can be restored by using items or finding health drops from monsters or environmental pieces. Magic power is drained by using shard skills, and if out of mana, the player cannot use shard skills, but mana can be similarly regained as with health.  The player gains new weapons, armor and accessories throughout the game by defeating monsters and looting chests. This equipment provides various attributes to Miriam along with offensive and defensive bonuses. For weapons, this also set the type of attacks that the player can make. For example, short swords allow a variety of fast, close-ranged attacks, spears enable slow but long-reaching attacks, and guns allow for long-distance shots but with no melee possibilities. The equipment can be changed on the fly via menu screens. Shards are obtained by defeating monsters, and generally contain a power reflecting the essence of the monster it came from. The player can only equip a limited number of shards, but like equipment, shards can be swapped out on the fly.  Among the maze of rooms include save rooms, allowing the player to save their game and fully regenerate Miriam's health and magic power. Additionally, warp rooms allow the player to quick jump from one region of the map to another previously discovered warp room. Following the game's prelude, the player also gains access to a set of non-playable characters located at the start of the map that provide stores to buy and sell weapons, shards, ingredients and crafting services to make new weapons or upgrade shards. The game is presented in a 2.5D style, presenting the game in three-dimensional graphics but restricting movement to a 2D system. Igarashi stated the choice for 2.5D was to follow the style of previous Castlevania games, such as The Dracula X Chronicles and Mirror of Fate.  "
126,Bloons TD 5,/wiki/Bloons_TD_5,Strategy,Ninja Kiwi,Ninja Kiwi,Unreleased,"June 13, 2018","June 19, 2018"," The main objective of Bloons TD is to prevent balloons, known in-game as ""Bloons"", from reaching the end of a defined track on a map which consists of one or more entrances and exits for the bloons. The game is a tower defense game and thus the player can choose various types of towers and traps at his or her disposal to place around the track in order to defend against the bloons, gaining 1 in-game dollar for every layer of bloon popped. If a bloon reaches the end of a path, the player loses lives (or in later games, health); once these are all depleted, the game ends. The bloons always follow the map's set path on the track until they either reach the exit(s), are popped, or are moved to an earlier part of the track by a tower's ability.  There are two classes of bloons in the game: regular (unnamed in the game) and MOAB-class. The regular bloons consist of: red, blue, green, yellow, pink, black, white, lead, zebra, rainbow, purple, and ceramic bloons. MOAB-class bloons are in the shape of a blimp and consist of: MOAB (Massive Ornary Air Blimp), BFB (Brutal Flying Behemoth), DDT (Dark Dirigible Titan), the ZOMG (Zeppelin Of Mighty Gargantuaness), and the BAD (Big Airship of Doom). Tougher variants of most bloon types contain a number of specified weaker ones. In later versions of the game, regular bloons possess sometimes special characteristics such as camo (which most towers cannot detect), regrowth (the ability for the bloons to slowly grow back to their original size), and fortified (which doubles the health of the toughest bloons), that resist certain tower types. With each level, the intensity of bloon waves proportionately increases.  Towers are the main defensive utility in the Bloons TD series. Each tower has its own unique purpose, power, and use, with some being powerful against specific bloons but unable to target others effectively. Every tower can be upgraded to increase power and other capabilities by spending the in-game currency, known simply as 'money', which is earned by popping bloons and at the end of each round. In Bloons TD 4 onwards, certain towers such as banana farms can be placed to produce additional money during a round (end of the round in Bloons TD 4).  In later games, there are multiple difficulty levels; for instance, in BTD5, there are four difficulty levels and in Bloons Monkey City there are 5. The higher the difficulty the player plays on, the fewer lives they have and the more each tower and upgrade cost. There are also different types of maps rated by difficulty; in general, there are more types of maps in newer games.  "

King Suren has to release his warriors from trees and rocks, and defeat King Ogereth's forces. The allies coming from trees and rocks only appear in the Famicom version.  In the earlier X1, MSX and PC computer versions, however, the player starts with a complete army and may gain some extra knights by freeing them from prison cells, not from trees or rocks. There are no soldiers turned into objects in the original computer versions.   The player can control three chess-like units: the King, Knight, and Pawn. Pressing the D-Pad will move King Suren and his army in the desired direction. Captive soldiers are freed using a knight to break the gates in front of them. In the Famicom version, the player starts the game with only King Suren at 597m, and acquires more allies by bumping against trees, cacti, rocks, and walls using King Suren, which will restore them to their normal form.  Throughout the world of Bokosuka there are obstacles only certain characters can pass. The gates in which Soldiers are locked can only be broken by Knights. Death tiles will kill all characters except Soldiers who will remove them when they step on them. The walls at 500m, 400m, 300m, and 200m can only be broken by King Suren.  When one unit collides with another, a battle takes place. The tile will change to an icon of crossed swords and a then a B (for battle). The victory is automatically calculated by the computer based on the difference between the offensive strengths of the units.  If King Suren dies, the game ends, announcing ""WOW! YOU LOSE!"". When King Suren succeeds in defeating King Ogreth, the game ends with ""BRAVO! YOU WIN!""

The chicken obtained this power after an accident involving the mysterious blue sauce that is being mined by BFC, a large fast-food chain. Unlike in most platformers, the chicken cannot jump; instead, it ascends by laying bombs which it stands on top of. The chicken can lay multiple bombs in a stack in order to reach higher places. The bombs automatically explode a few seconds after laying them, so the chicken must move quickly after laying them. Bombs can be pushed by the chicken so that they fly into enemies and obstacles. The chicken uses these abilities to try to escape BFC's mining operation, with settings including a factory and overgrown Mesoamerican ruins. The chicken faces several foes, ranging from BFC workers to aggressive natives, most of which can be defeated by using a bomb or landing on top of them. Obstacles include blocks which can be blown up, flying arrows, platforms that fall when the chicken steps on them, and fireballs that hop out of lava. Switches are a common puzzle element and can be pressed to open mechanical doors. Some of them are on a timer, while others only stay active if something stays on top of them. Certain doors are also opened by taking keycards to them. The game has a total of 29 levels spread across three worlds.  The chicken dies after taking one hit, after which it loses a life, which only replenishes after clearing a level or getting a game over, which happens when the chicken loses all its lives. Within the levels are blue gems that the chicken can collect, as well as hidden rooms which house even more gems. Between each level is an opportunity to trade a certain number gems to increase the player's maximum extra lives. With each trade, the threshold for gems increases, so the player will have to collect more gems across multiple levels in order to meet this minimum requirement.  "

The weapons can be dated to increase their power, although the game also contains a ""platonic"" relationship with a cat. The personalities of the weapon characters are based on their weapon type.   The game's combat takes place in real time from an isometric perspective. The player can perform different combos depending on their weapon.

140,Brawl,/wiki/Basement_Crawl,Action,Bloober Team,QubicGames,Unreleased,"January 12, 2018","January 19, 2018"," Basement Crawl is a maze-based action game with some strategic elements. Bloober Team's main inspirations were old classics like Spy vs. Spy and Bomberman, and gameplay revolves around setting up traps (self-detonated or activated by characters approaching it or stepping on it without noticing) to hurt other players.  It's focused on multiplayer, but basic single player campaigns with bots to fill in for missing characters will be available too.  Basement Crawl is a 2.5D game with dynamic cameras – to the game modes, characters and mechanics. ""We felt that many games nowadays are dependent on character development or luck and randomness, so we designed Basement Crawl to exclude the luck factor and remove the dependence on leveling-up characters. We want to make Basement Crawl as skill-based as possible and focus on hardcore players instead of casual or ‘middlecore’ players.""  Basement Crawl supports both 4 player hot-seat and 8 player online play, as well as combinations of both. At the beginning, players start with a selection of 4 available characters, all with their own unique skills balanced carefully against each other. The first three characters are a midget clown, a crash-test dummy, and a girl with a bear.  "
141,Brawlhalla,/wiki/Brawlhalla,Fighting,Blue Mammoth Games,Ubisoft,"September 5, 2019","November 6, 2018","November 6, 2018"," In most of Brawlhalla's game modes, the goal is to knock one's opponent off the stage, comparable to Super Smash Bros. This can be done by damaging them repeatedly. Damage can be seen on the color display around the opponent's character icon, which goes from white to red to black as the player continues to get hit. The closer the color is to red, the farther the player will be knocked back, until they eventually get knocked out. Getting knocked off the stage will result in the player losing a life. Either the last player standing (the one who still has at least one life) or the player with the most points wins the match.  The game supports both local and online play. Competitive players can compete 1-on-1 to climb through the rankings. They can also find a partner to play against other duos to increase their collaborative rank. Brawlhalla also has several casual modes: Free-For-All, 1v1 Strikeout, Experimental 1v1, and a different featured mode every week. Free-For-All is a chaotic mode where 4 players knock each other out to gain points. In 1v1 Strikeout, players pick 3 characters which they play for 1 stock each. Experimental 1v1 allows players to test out upcoming features against each other. Custom games can be hosted online and locally, and they support up to 8 players per match, experimental maps, and region changing. You may join groups of your friends to create a clan, with multiple ranks within the clans. Clans gain experience from all members.  Brawlhalla features simple controls and one-button special moves. This allows new players to pick up the game quickly. Controls include movement keys and buttons for attacking, performing special moves, picking up or throwing weapons, and dodging. Keys can be rebound for keyboard and a large variety of controllers.  Players can move by running left and right and jumping. Players can perform quick dashes sideways while on the ground, and dodges while in the air or on the ground, either sideways or vertically. It is also possible to dodge right after an attack to keep pressure on the opponent. Once in the air, the player has the option to perform any combination of: three jumps, a directional air-dodge, a grounded move in the air by using a ""gravity-cancel"", and ""fast-falling"". It is also possible to hold on to the sides of stages, similar to the style in Mega Man.  During a match, gadgets and weapon drops fall from the sky semi-randomly and can be picked up by the players. Although the weapon drop sprite has the appearance of a sword it turns into a corresponding weapon for the legend that picks it up. All of Brawlhalla's characters can use 2 weapons out of 12 to fight each other. Weapons include blasters, katars, rocket lances, swords, spears, cannons, axes, gauntlets, hammers, bows, scythes, and magic orbs. Blasters, lances, bows, and spears perform well at a distance from the opponent, while katars and gauntlets are more effective up close. Rocket lance allows for quick traversal of the stage. Axes, cannons, and hammers all do large amounts of damage. Swords, orbs, and scythes are fast and low damaging. All characters have unarmed attacks, should they be disarmed. Gadgets like bombs, mines, and spike balls are also used. Weapons can also be thrown to interrupt the enemy's moves or to make it difficult for them to get back to the stage. Each character has 3 special or ""signature"" moves per weapon, for a total of 6 per character.  Four stats are assigned to each character: Strength, Dexterity, Defense and Speed. The combination of these stats determines the strengths and weaknesses of a character and affects how they're played, and can be slightly modified using stances- which move a point from one stat to another.

The game features 25 playable characters, including guest fighters from Hyper Light Drifter, Guacamelee!, Yooka-Laylee, and Dead Cells. Characters use a variety of fighting moves and special attacks. Each attack does damage, increasing the opponent's damage percent. When the damage increases, the victim flies further. The purpose of each battle is to throw one's opponents off the stage.  Brawlout does not use blocking, and most characters are incapable of grabbing others. Instead, its gameplay is based on combos. Fighting builds up the player's Rage Meter, which fuels powerful special attacks, and adds an extra layer of strategy, by triggering the Combo Breaker or Rage Mode.  "
143,Breakers Collection,/wiki/Breakers_Collection,Fighting,Visco Corporation,QuByte Interactive,Unreleased,2020,2020," The controls of the game is similar to that of SNK's earlier installments in their Fatal Fury series (particularly Fatal Fury 2, Special and 3). The special actions are also similar to other fighting games from the same era, although the dashing and back-stepping techniques tend to differ between characters (some of them will roll on the floor for example). Additionally, the player can move while standing up after a fall. The game system emphasizes balance between characters by featuring an elaborate damage adjustment feature.  The player also can perform super moves by accumulating enough energy in their power gauge and performing the command (the power gauge can be filled up to three levels). To accumulate energy for the Power Gauge, the player must perform special actions such as taunting, dashing, back-stepping, rolling, etc. Like most fighting games, the player can cancel a regular move into a special move or special move into a super move, but the player can also connect one super move to another until their Power Gauge runs out, allowing the player to perform acrobatic combos. Because of its emphasis on damage adjustment, it is hard to spam the same attacks for great damage.  The matches follows the standard one-on-one best two-of-three format like most fighting games, but a match can last up to five rounds if there is no clear-cut winner in previous rounds (the game will end if both fighters lose the fifth round and no bonus points will be awarded if one wins the fifth round). In the single player mode, if the CPU uses the same character as the player, then the CPU-controlled character's name display will have a different name.  The home versions of the game were released for the Neo-Geo AES and the Neo-Geo CD. Both versions feature an option menu with a sound test allowing the player to play the game's music, sound effects and voices. The CD version adds a 2-player Versus Mode and a Survival Mode.  The music is also slightly-arranged. The final boss Bai-Hu is also a playable character in the CD version.   The following plot summary is translated from the home versions' manual:  Somewhere in Hong Kong, two martial artists face each other in a vast courtyard. The challenger is a stout man in brown skin. The ground has been tainted with blood. However, his crescent blade has not touched his opponent yet. It was a one-sided battle. He was already exhausted and it will not be long before he　would fall. ""Fool, you will become one of my family"" resounded the opponent's voice, as the challenger crumbled to the floor and was turned into sand.  The Fighting Instinct Tournament, or FIST, is a tournament as fierce as its name suggests. There was no shortage of martial artists who entered the tournament seeking fame, and yet there were many who left the tournament as corpses. The last challenger who remains in this lawless tournament gets to challenge the organizer of the tournament, the Head of the Huang Financial Clique, for the chance to win the massive prize money. The martial artist who can manage to defeat him will obtain the honor of truly calling him or herself the strongest. However, none of the martial artists who were chosen to challenge the champion in a private final match have ever come back alive. Nobody knows when exactly the tournament is held, since only an avaricious will was spiraling over there. The sponsor is actually an evil spirit who possessed the body of a modern man from Hong Kong who has established a selection system to amplify his dark powers. The FIST tournament has gathered numerous participants from around the globe and another sacrifice will be chosen this year.  "

The game's puzzles are inspired by the art of M. C. Escher and like his artworks, each level unfolds in grayscale with hand-drawn illustrations. The player can rotate the world using the arrow keys, changing the gravitational direction of individual objects, or control the main character with A and D to go left and right. The Wii U version utilizes the GamePad touch and accelerometer. The player can use the Wii U GamePad touch capabilities to interact with the world to move the character, open doors, activate objects, and interact with the menu system and UI. The player can also tilt the Wii U GamePad to rotate gravity in the game.   The game opens with the nameless main character sleeping under an apple tree. After an apple hits him in the head and wakes him up, he is guided to his house with three doors, behind which lie further doors and levels.

Players are tasked with designing and constructing bridges to get one or more trucks from one location to another at Aperture Laboratories under the supervision of the artificial intelligence GLaDOS.  The game merges elements from the Bridge Constructor series and Portal series. Players are tasked with building bridges using struts (which can be converted to road segments) and cables, anchored to pre-designated fixed points on the level's walls. The limited availability of fixed points may require the player to construct self-supporting bridges. These bridges must be able to withstand their own weight, as well as the trucks and any force they impart when landing on the bridge. Elements from Portal require the player to guide the trucks across the bridges, navigate through portals, cross over buttons to open doors or other actions, avoid coming in sight of sentry turrets or in contact with deadly fluid or laser fields, and use other Portal gameplay elements like propulsion and repulsion gels and launching pads.  Players can switch between construction mode, test mode, and vehicle mode to visualize their solution. Test mode simulates the physics of the level to see how the bridge components stand up under their own weight. Vehicle mode sends one or more trucks through the player's solution. During either of these, the game shows any struts or cables that are under stress (highlighted in red). If they exceed their stress limit, they will break and cause the bridge to collapse. If the player designs a bridge to successfully allow one vehicle to pass, they can then try to send a convoy of vehicles through the course. These vehicles are released one at a time at regular intervals, and tests to see if the bridge components stand up to repeated stress or if the crossing of paths causes any collisions.  There is no building limit for a level, but each bridge component placed in a solution has a monetary value, and the player is challenged separately to keep the total monetary value as low as possible. The player clears a puzzle by getting one vehicle across, but is rated higher by getting all of the vehicles in a convoy through the course without harm.  "
146,Broforce,/wiki/Broforce,Action,Free Lives,Devolver Digital,"September 6, 2018","September 6, 2018","September 6, 2018"," The player-character is a bro, a hypermasculine action hero-style commando, who fights terrorists and rescues his bro teammates and prisoners of war from captivity. The game's destructible environments wear away with the player's gunfire. The levels end when the player defeats a devil boss, hoists an American flag, and leaves via helicopter while the scenery explodes.  The Broforce initially includes several characters, and the player earns more as they rescue a certain number of prisoners of war. These Broforce characters, under direction of ""Nelson Brodela"", are parodies of fictional action heroes, including John Rambo, Die Hard's John McClane, Chuck Norris, Mr. T, Alien's Ellen Ripley, and Terminator's T-800; they are often named by adding the word ""bro"" to the original name in some manner (e.g., Rambro, the Brominator). The player does not have control on which Broforce character they will start the level with, and each time that character dies or a prisoner of war is rescued, they will be switched to a different Broforce character. Each character has unique attacks and moves based on the fictional hero; for example, Ripley's character has a flamethrower special ability, while the Indiana Jones-based character primarily uses a whip.

The game features two playable characters, each located in seemingly separate worlds; the player can switch from one character to the other via the game's interface at any time, but otherwise these characters do not interact in any direct way. The game employs context-sensitive actions instead of using verb lists as early adventure games would use, as Schafer stated that in essence, ""there really was always one verb, which was 'interact with'"" and opted for the more modern approach. Each character has separate item inventories as they collect objects; items can then be used by dragging them onto context-sensitive areas on the screen or combined with other inventory items.   "

Bub and Bob have to finish 100 levels in the Cave of Monsters in order to rescue them.  In the game, each player controls one of the two dragons. Players can move along platforms, fall to lower ones, and jump to higher ones and over gaps. Each level is limited to a single screen, with no scrolling; however, if a screen has gaps in its bottom edge, players can fall through these and reappear at the top. Each level has a certain number of enemies that must be defeated in order to advance. The players must blow bubbles to trap the enemies, then burst these bubbles by colliding with them. Each enemy defeated in this manner turns into a food item that can be picked up for extra points. Defeating multiple enemies at once awards higher scores and causes more valuable food items to appear. All bubbles will float for a certain length of time before bursting on their own; players can jump on these and ride them to otherwise inaccessible areas. Magic items appear from time to time and grant special abilities and advantages when picked up. Special bubbles occasionally appear that can be burst to attack enemies with fire, water, or lightning. Furthermore, if a player collects letter bubbles to form extend, a bonus life is earned and both players immediately advance to the next level.  A player loses one life upon touching any free enemies or their projectiles (rocks, fireballs, lasers, bottles).  Enemies turn ""angry""—turning pink in color and moving faster—if they escape from a bubble after being left too long or the players spend a certain amount of time on the current level. They return to normal if either player loses a life. After a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements. These disappear once the level is cleared, or when a player loses a life. When there is only one enemy left, it immediately becomes angry and remains in this state until defeated.  In the 100th and final level, players face a boss. This is one of the first games to feature multiple endings. Completing Level 100 in single-player mode reveals a message stating that the game has not truly ended and a hint to the player: ""Come here with your friend."" If two players complete the game, they see a ""happy end"", in which the brothers are transformed to their human selves and reunited with their girlfriends. This ending also includes a code that, when deciphered, allows the game to be played in the faster and more difficult ""super"" mode. If this mode is completed with two players, a second ""happy end"" is displayed in which Super Drunk (the defeated boss) is revealed to be the brothers' parents under the control of some outside influence. The brothers return to normal and are reunited with their parents and girlfriends.  "

158,Burnout Paradise Remastered,/wiki/Burnout_Paradise_Remastered,Racing,Criterion Games,Electronic Arts,"June 19, 2020","June 19, 2020","June 19, 2020"," Burnout Paradise is set in an open-world environment. Players have the opportunity to progress at their own pace and level; the game, unlike others, is not actually set to a rigid gameplay framework. According to Alex Ward, creative director of the game at developer Criterion Games, this game is a ""complete reinvention"" of the Burnout series. He also said ""To create truly next-generation gameplay, we needed to create a truly next-generation game from the ground up.""  Initially day and night cycles were not included in the game but a software update entitled ""Davis"" added this element to the game. For the first time in the series, records are now kept on a player's drivers license, including statistics such as fastest time and biggest crash for every street in the game. Completing events raises the driver rank, which unlocks access to new cars.  In previous Burnout games, ""Crash Mode"", was a dedicated mode in which players were given multiple scenarios in which to cause the biggest crash.  In Burnout Paradise, ""Crash Mode"", now called ""Showtime"", can be initiated at any time and place in the game. Showtime does differ from the previous incarnation of Crash Mode being that instead of crashing into a busy intersection and watching a crash play out, Showtime has you bounce the vehicle around for as long as possible to gain points. During a race players may now take any route to get to the destination. Races and other events are started by simply stopping at any of the traffic lights and applying the accelerator and brake at the same time. The game features the ability to customize race settings, such as traffic, race routes, and including/excluding cars based on their boost types.  Paradise's damage system has also been reworked. There are now two different types of crashes based on the car's condition after the crash. If the player's car manages to retain all four wheels and does not break its chassis, the player can drive out of the crash and continue playing; this is called a ""driveaway"". If a player's car loses any wheels, the engine is damaged too much from an impact, the car lands on its side or roof or lands outside of the game's map, the car is in a ""wrecked"" state and the player will have to wait until their car is reset. Cars dynamically compress and deform around objects they crash into.  Cars now have manufacturer and model names, which are loosely based on real-world cars. Cars may not be ""tuned up"" or customized apart from color changes, which may be done in real-time by driving through the forecourt of a paint shop, or by selecting the color during vehicle selection. Other real-time changes include driving through the forecourt of a gas station to automatically refill the vehicle's boost meter, and driving through the forecourt of a repair shop to automatically repair the vehicle.

Players play the majority of the game as either Link or Princess Zelda, with other characters such as NecroDancer protagonist Cadence becoming unlocked by progressing through the game or completing certain quests, each with their own unique abilities. Players venture across the overworld, composed of predefined regions and map layouts related to Zelda lore such as Hyrule Castle or Death Mountain, but whose relative placement is procedurally generated for each new save file. This map remains the same throughout the entire game, but certain dungeons such as those found in temples will be randomly generated every time they are visited. Whenever enemies are in an area, the player is required to move and attack in time to the music using the directional buttons, with bonus multipliers and extra rewards available for maintaining the beat. Throughout the game, the player can find or purchase weapons and equipment, such as shovels for digging through dirt or torches that can reveal the contents of chests, as well as recurring Zelda items such as bows, bombs, and hook shots.  Partially carrying over roguelike elements from NecroDancer, the player will lose amassed rupees and temporary items if they lose all of their health. Diamonds, which can be found in dungeons or earned by defeating every enemy in an area, are retained even if the player gets a game over. Players can activate Sheikah Stones in certain areas, which they can either fast travel to or respawn from following a death. The game features optional modes such as ""fixed-beat mode"", which removes the need to play to the music, and permadeath mode, which challenges players to play through the campaign without dying once. The game can also be played co-operatively with a second player on the same Switch unit with each player using one Joy-Con to move.   In the Kingdom of Hyrule, a mysterious man named Octavo uses a magical Lute to put Hyrule's king, as well as Link and Zelda, to sleep, before using the Triforce of Power to turn his Lute into a Golden Lute. In this time of need, Cadence is mysteriously transported to Hyrule by the Triforce and manages to wake up Link and Zelda. While Cadence goes off to try to find a way home, Link and Zelda travel across Hyrule to find and defeat Octavo's four champions, who each possess enchanted instruments containing musical power. After Link and Zelda, soon rejoined by Cadence, obtain the instruments and enter Hyrule Castle, Octavo reveals that he and his champions were meant to be used to battle against Ganon, who will take over Hyrule in the future. Finding himself defeated, Octavo opens a portal into the future, where Link, Zelda, and Cadence confront Ganon and combine their forces to defeat him. With help from the Golden Lute, Link and Zelda use the power of the Triforce to try and send Cadence back to her own world.  "

Like the previous Call of Juarez games, the game consists of completing objectives to progress through the game. Staple gameplay elements of the series such as bullet-time and gunslinger duels make a return. A novel element is the occasional ability to dodge bullets via a quick time event.  The player can earn experience points and level up their skills, specializing in either dual pistols, shotguns, or rifles. The game allows the player to carry their accumulated skills over to replays, so they can eventually fully master all categories.  Scattered throughout the game are collectible secret items called ""Nuggets of Truth"", which recount the historical truths behind Silas' tales.  The story levels take place in the imagination of one of the bar patrons as Silas Greaves, an unreliable narrator, relates his travels.  As his audience challenges the lies and inconsistencies in his tales, Silas revises his story, which results in abrupt changes to game environment (such as the sudden appearance and disappearance of an Apache army).  Aside from the Story mode, there is an Arcade mode wherein the player can fight off waves of enemies and a Duel mode where they can have a series of classic gun-slinger showdowns.   In 1910, a legendary old bounty hunter named Silas Greaves enters a saloon in Abilene, Kansas and regales the patrons with tales of his adventures in exchange for free drinks. The patrons, Steve, Jack, and a teenager named Dwight, awe-struck at first, grow increasingly incredulous and irritated the more they listen to his ludicrous stories, in which he takes credit for the killings of numerous legendary outlaws including Butch Cassidy and Newman Haynes Clanton. At the end, just as the patrons are about to become fully enraged by Silas' over the top accounts of his travels, he reveals that Ben, the bartender, is in fact Roscoe ""Bob"" Bryant, one of the three bandits that murdered Silas' brothers and set him on the path of a bounty hunter. The player is then given a choice whether to challenge Bob to a duel, thus fulfilling Silas' vendetta at long last, or letting him go, in which case Silas finally lets go of the hate and anger that has been driving him for years.  The ending reveals that Dwight is indeed Dwight Eisenhower on his way to West Point. If the player chooses the ""redemption"" option and forgives Bob for his actions, Silas reveals he had been deliberately exaggerating his tales to confirm his suspicions, with details Ben would know only if he were Roscoe. Silas then asks Dwight what he plans to do with his life, and upon hearing that he's becoming a soldier, Silas says: ""Well, you do it right then, son. Don't tear down the world out of anger and spite like I did. You build it up. You do something decent with your life. You hear me?"" to which Dwight says, ""Sir, yes sir"" and sets out to become the 34th President of the United States, and if the player chooses the ""revenge"" option, Silas duels with Bob, with Silas emerging as the victor. Everyone present at the bar becomes cautious to Silas, with Dwight being highly disturbed.  "

In the game, players control Captain Toad, a Toad, and his companion Toadette, attempting to safely navigate through various obstacles and reach a gold star at the end of each level. Completing the original version allows players to see the link between Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker and Super Mario 3D World, and having save data from the latter or beating Treasure Tracker allows players to play four 3D World levels as Captain Toad. Meanwhile, the Switch version has an updated ending linked to Super Mario Odyssey and scanning the Wedding Amiibo unlocks four bonus levels adapted from Odyssey.

Both characters can be hit once before dying, but collecting mushrooms restores their health. As in Super Mario 3D World, Captain Toad can also walk and run, but cannot jump due to his heavy backpack. As in Super Mario Bros. 2, he can pull up plants from the ground, granting the player coins or turnips to throw at enemies. He can also use the Super Pickax to clear out enemies and obstacle blocks, similar to the hammer in Donkey Kong. The game makes use of the Wii U GamePad's features, as the player can touch the screen to manipulate platforms, blow on the microphone to activate certain platforms, and use gyroscopic controls to aim turnips while riding mine carts. The game makes use of amiibo: using the Toad amiibo places a ""pixel Toad"" in levels for Captain Toad to find; other figurines give the player extra lives.   The game opens with Captain Toad and Toadette ascending a tower together to claim a Power Star. The villainous giant crow Wingo appears and steals the star, taking Toadette along with him when she grabs hold of it. The player guides Toad as he tracks Wingo down to his lair and rescues Toadette.

168,Carcassonne,/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game),Board game,Asmodee,Asmodee,Unreleased,"December 6, 2018","December 6, 2018"," The game board is a medieval landscape built by the players as the game progresses. The game starts with a single terrain tile face up and 71 others shuffled face down for the players to draw from. On each turn a player draws a new terrain tile and places it adjacent to tiles that are already face up.  The new tile must be placed in a way that extends features on the tiles it touches: roads must connect to roads, fields to fields, and cities to cities.  After placing each new tile, the placing player may opt to station a piece (called a ""follower"" or ""meeple"") on a feature of that newly placed tile. The placing player may not use a follower to claim any features of the tile that extend or connect features already claimed by another player. However, it is possible for terrain features claimed by opposing players to become ""shared"" by the subsequent placement of tiles connecting them. For example, two separate field tiles (each with a follower) can become connected into a single field by another terrain tile.  The game ends when the last tile has been placed. At that time, all features (including fields) score points for the players with the most followers on them. The player with the most points wins the game.  Game interest  Carcassonne is considered to be an excellent ""gateway game"" by many board game players as it is a game that can be used to introduce new players to board games. The rules are simple, no one is ever eliminated, and the play is fast. A typical game, without any expansions, takes about 45 minutes to play.  There is a substantial luck component to the game; however, good tactics greatly improve one's chances of winning. Examples of tactical considerations include:  "

After selecting a character, the player then selects a starting stage through an overworld map.  After completing a stage, the player has the choice to revisit it or to move to another stage. The map also displays shops where the player character can buy items and weapons using coins gained from defeated foes and chests. Arena stages can be unlocked where the player character can take on challenges to unlock additional characters.  Castle Crashers supports cooperative gameplay for up to four players, either locally or online. The game progression in terms of what stages are unlocked is defined by the player who is furthest along, although some levels require all players to have unlocked them before proceeding to them; however, each player character will gain experience points and acquire wealth, weapons, and animal orbs independently as they progress with the rest of the party.  In each stage, the player can use melee and combination attacks. Each character has a unique magical ability in order to defeat foes and a health meter that, if drained from enemy attacks, will cause the character to fall in battle. In single player mode, this ends the stage; however, in cooperative multiplayer other players may attempt to revive the downed character.  Characters gain experience points by damaging foes which allow the character to level up. Each level gained allows the player to allocate points towards the character's four basic combat attributes. Certain level advances also grant new combination attacks. Progress is tracked for each of the playable characters separately.  The character's magic level is also tracked by a meter and regenerates over time. Numerous weapons can be found in the game, each that have various effects to the character's attributes when equipped. The player can find animal companions for their character that may assist in battle, improve the character's attributes, or provide another special ability such as increased treasure earned from defeated foes.  Each version of the game features two minigames. In Arena, the first minigame, player characters attempt to survive through several waves of enemies, or fight each other. This minigame is available on all versions. The Xbox 360, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows versions feature a minigame called ""All You Can Quaff,"" a button-mashing contest to attempt to eat as much food as possible. The PlayStation 3 version, however, features a Volleyball minigame for up to four players and four AI characters.   Castle Crashers is set in a fictional medieval universe. It begins with four knights attending a party in a king's castle. During the party, a dark wizard arrives, stealing a mystical gem and capturing four princesses. The king sends the knights to retrieve the gem, rescue his daughters, and bring the wizard to justice. The knights encounter several enemies along the way, including, but not limited to, other knights, multiple encounters with a cyclops and his friend, thieves, a giant ""catfish"", factory workers, monstrous oceans with ninja pirates, demons, necromancers, and alien invaders. As the knights progress they succeed in rescuing the princesses, and ultimately the journey culminates in a final showdown with the wizard. The knights emerge victorious from the confrontation, having defeated the dark wizard, rescuing all of the king's daughters, and recovering the mystical gem. The knights then ride the reclaimed gem through several empty battlefields on their trip back to the castle. At the castle the king brings one of his daughters for one of the knights to kiss, her face veiled throughout the entire game. As with previous levels, the players fight to the death to claim a kiss from the princess. However, when the winner tries to do so this time, the princess is revealed to be a clown that blankets the screen in an animation.  "

176,Castlevania Anniversary Collection,/wiki/Castlevania_Anniversary_Collection,Platformer,Konami,Konami,"May 16, 2019","May 16, 2019","May 16, 2019","Games  Many Castlevania titles have been released for markets in Japan, North America, Europe and Australia on various video game consoles, personal computers (PC) and mobile phones, with additional remakes and re-releases. The first console title, Castlevania, was released on the Famicom Disk System in 1986 and then in North America in 1987 on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). A 2D sidescrolling action game where the player progresses through six stages, many principal features of the Castlevania series originated with it. It has since been ported to many platforms, such as the NES Classic Edition. Also released in 1986 was Vampire Killer for the MSX home computer, which played significantly different from the original Castlevania, where players now had to search for the exit before they could proceed to the next stage. Following that year, in 1987, Castlevania II: Simon's Quest further departed from the standard platforming genre of the first Castlevania for a game more similar to the nonlinear gameplay of Metroid, with several RPG elements such as a world map which the player is free to explore and revisit. Castlevania's first arcade game, Haunted Castle (1988), returned to the linear platforming gameplay of the original. This continued with the first handheld Game Boy entry, Castlevania: The Adventure and the NES sequel, Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse, both released in 1989. Dracula's Curse added new features to the original gameplay, including alternate stages and multiple playable characters. The Adventure saw a Game Boy sequel, Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge, in 1992 and also a remake developed by M2 for the WiiWare service in 2009.  The franchise's first 16-bit home console game, Super Castlevania IV, was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) in 1992. A Castlevania title for the Sharp X68000 home computer was exclusively released in Japan in 1993 and would not be available in English until Castlevania Chronicles (2001) for the PlayStation. During the same year, Castlevania: Rondo of Blood was released for the PC Engine and was also not localized in English until it was included with Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles (2007) for the PlayStation Portable. The first Castlevania produced for a CD-ROM, Rondo of Blood featured Red Book Audio and fully voiced dialogue. The game's content would be reused in Castlevania: Dracula X, a new game for the SNES in 1995. Castlevania: Bloodlines (1994) was the first Castlevania entry produced for a Sega console, the Genesis, and was not re-released until 2019 on the multi-platform Castlevania Anniversary Collection.  In 1997, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and Castlevania Legends were launched for the PlayStation and Game Boy, respectively. Symphony of the Night introduced a major change to the gameplay, incorporating RPG elements and a non-linear map that the player could freely explore, which was previously seen in Simon's Quest and Nintendo's Metroid series. This would be the gameplay for several future titles, beginning with the Game Boy Advance entries Circle of the Moon, Harmony of Dissonance and Aria of Sorrow, which were released from 2001 to 2003. Aria of Sorrow received a 2005 sequel for the Nintendo DS, which was followed by Portrait of Ruin (2006) and Order of Ecclesia (2008).  Under the development of Konami's Kobe branch, the first game in the series to employ 3D graphics was Castlevania for Nintendo 64 in 1999, and it received an expansion called Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness later that year.  In 2003, the next 3D Castlevania title, Lament of Innocence debuted for the PlayStation 2 with combat-oriented hack and slash gameplay that drew comparisons to Devil May Cry and God of War. It was followed two years later by another PlayStation 2 title, Castlevania: Curse of Darkness. A reboot of the Castlevania series premiered with Castlevania: Lords of Shadow (2010), a multi-platform 3D action title developed by MercurySteam and co-produced by Metal Gear's Hideo Kojima. Two sequels, Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate (2013) and Lords of Shadow 2 (2014) have also both received multi-platform releases.  "

179,Catan,/wiki/Catan,Board game,Magic Pockets,Asmodee,"June 20, 2019","June 20, 2019","June 20, 2019"," The players in the game represent settlers establishing settlments on the island of Catan. Players build settlements, cities, and roads to connect them as they settle the island. The game board, which represents the island, is composed of hexagonal tiles (hexes) of different land types, which are laid out randomly at the beginning of each game. Newer editions of the game began to depict a fixed layout in their manual, which has been proven by computer simulations to be fairly even-handed, and recommend this to be used by beginners. In 2016, editions of the game were released with a conventional fixed layout board in this configuration, the hexes of which cannot be rearranged.  Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource- hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep. On each player's turn, two six-sided dice are rolled to determine which hexes produce resources. Players with a settlement adjacent to a hex containing the number just rolled receive one card of the corresponding resource; cities produce two cards of the corresponding resource. For example, if a player has one city and two settlements adjacent to a grain hex, that player would take four grain resource cards if the corresponding number was rolled.  There is also a robber token, initially placed on the desert; if a player rolls 7, the robber must be moved to another hex, which will no longer produce resources until the robber is moved again. That player may also steal a resource card from another player with a settlement or city adjacent to the robber's new placement. In addition, when a 7 is rolled, all players with 8 or more resource cards must discard their choice of half of their cards, rounded down. For example, If a player has 9 resource cards, and a 7 is rolled, the player must get rid of 4 cards.  On the player's turn, the player may spend resource cards to build roads, settlements, upgrade settlements to cities (which replace existing settlements), or development cards. Players can trade resource cards between each other; players may also trade off-island (in effect, with the non-player bank) at a ratio of four-to-one resource for one of any other. By building settlements adjacent to ports, players may trade with the bank at three-to-one (three of any single resource type) or two-to-one (two of a specific resource) ratios, depending on the port's location.  The goal of the game is to reach ten victory points. Players score one point for each settlement they own and two for each city. Various other achievements, such as establishing the longest road and the largest army (by playing the most knight cards), grant a player additional victory points.  Resource cards can also be spent to buy a development card. Three types of development cards include cards worth one victory point; knight cards, which allow the player to move the robber as if they had rolled a 7 (but without the remove-half rule); and a third set of cards which allow the player one of three abilities when played.  Teuber's original design was for a large game of exploration and development in a new land. Between 1993 and 1995 Teuber and Kosmos refined and simplified the game into its current form. Unused mechanics from that design went on to be used in Teuber's following games, Entdecker and Löwenherz. The game's first expansion, Catan: Seafarers, adds the concept of exploration, and the combined game (sometimes known as ""New Shores"") is probably the closest game to Teuber's original intentions.

The gameplay is divided into two parts; daytime social simulation segments where Vincent interacts with various characters at the Stray Sheep bar, and nightmare segments where he navigates deadly block towers using a combination of platforming and puzzle solving. The game is split into three modes; the single-player story campaign dubbed ""Golden Playhouse"", and ""Babel"". Multiplayer-exclusive ""Colosseum"" challenge levels are unlocked after first completing the story.  The daytime gameplay has Vincent interacting with his girlfriends and other characters in the Stray Sheep bar. During dialogue and text segments, Vincent can choose several options to respond; these include standard dialogue options and composing text messages. During his time in the Stray Sheep, Vincent can Purchase drinks which help his navigation of Nightmare stages, but also impede his movement if he has too many. He can also play a minigame titled ""Rapunzel"" which mimics the gameplay in nightmares, or listen to a jukebox containing tracks from other Atlus games. Leaving the Stray Sheep will trigger the next Nightmare section.  The main gameplay takes place in the Nightmare stages. Vincent must climb towers made of blocks, which Vincent must arrange into a stairway to reach the exit. As he climbs, the tower collapses beneath him, and if he fails to arrange the blocks before the collapse reaches him, Vincent will fall and the game ends; he either restarts from the last checkpoint on the tower if Vincent has a pillow item, or the player must restart the game from their last save. Blocks can be freely pushed and pulled, balanced on the edge of a similar block, and form stairways. In addition to standard blocks, some blocks have additional functions such as springing Vincent higher, and some blocks are lethal traps. Vincent can earn pillows that allow him to retry levels. There are also several items which can be found or purchased in between stages, such as spare blocks, lightning which removes enemies, and energy drinks that allow Vincent to climb more steps at a time.  Completing a stage awards a score based on the time completed and items collected. These are posted on online leader boards accessed from the game's start menu. In addition to the Golden Playhouse mode, Babel Mode features four large stages playable with up to two players, while Colosseum features two players simultaneously playing a stage in order to reach the top first. The game has multiple endings depending on the choices made by the player during the course of the narrative.  Additional elements were added in Full Body. A new mode features rearranged versions of the game's puzzles, with the original game's arrangement featuring as a separate mode. A new online multiplayer mode is also added, where players can enter both a randomised match or a contest with a player of equal rank. New character Rin can be called to halt the tower's collapse for a short time. Players can access a new difficulty level called ""Safety"", which removes all threats and time limit, and allows players to skip puzzles and continue with the story.  "

Defeating enemies sometimes yield yellow triangular objects, which give experience points to weapons when collected. Weapons may be improved up to level three, but taking damage causes weapons to lose experience and levels. Health and missile capacity upgrades are scattered throughout the game world.

183,Celeste,/wiki/Celeste_(video_game),Platformer,Matt Makes Games,Matt Makes Games,"May 10, 2018","January 25, 2018","January 25, 2018"," Celeste is a platform game in which players control a girl named Madeline as she makes her way up a mountain while avoiding various deadly obstacles. Along with jumping and climbing up walls for a limited amount of time, Madeline has the ability to perform a mid-air dash in the eight cardinal and intercardinal directions. This move can only be performed once and must be replenished by either landing on the ground, hitting certain objects such as replenishing crystals, or moving to a new screen (although the player is granted a second dash later on in the game). Throughout each level, the player will encounter additional mechanics, such as springs that launch the player or feathers that allow brief flight, and deadly objects such as spikes which kill Madeline (returning her to the start of the room).  Players can also access an Assist Mode, where they can change some attributes about the game's physics. Some of these include: infinite air-dashes, invincibility, or slowing the game's speed. Hidden throughout most ""A-Side"" chapters of the game are optional strawberries, obtained through challenging platforming or puzzle solving sections, which slightly affect the game's ending depending on how many are collected, as well as a cassette tape that unlocks a ""B-Side"", which provides harder platforming puzzles using the mechanics introduced in the A-Side. Optional ""crystal hearts"" used to access post-game content are also found in each A-side. Beating all the B-Sides then unlocks the ""C-Side"" versions, which are very hard but short stages which expand further upon the mechanics in the A- and B-Sides. B-Sides, C Sides, and the Farewell DLC chapter all teach the player more complicated movement techniques that are needed to clear otherwise impossible obstacles. Upon clearing all C-Sides, the player can access the Variants menu, which allows players to change the game's physics in a way similar to the game's Assist Mode. Some of these ""variants"" include: speeding the game up, 360 degree dashing, and low friction. These serve to make the game both more challenging and fun. The original Celeste Classic Pico-8 prototype can also be found as a hidden minigame.   A young woman named Madeline begins climbing Celeste Mountain, ignoring a warning from an old woman, named Granny (or Celia in the final chapter), who lives at the base. Madeline makes her way through a deserted city, where she can meet with a fellow traveler named Theo. Madeline camps out for the night and has a dream in which a dark reflection of herself breaks out of a mirror, and attempts to stop Madeline's climb, but Madeline escapes from it and wakes up from her nightmare.  Madeline continues into an old hotel on the mountain, where the hotel's ghostly concierge, Mr. Oshiro, tries to persuade Madeline to stay despite the dingy condition of the hotel. She reluctantly entertains him by cleaning part of the resort, but he is keen on having her stay for a night. This leads to the reflection reappearing and creating an escape for Madeline, but insulting Oshiro in the process, enraging him. He chases Madeline out, and Madeline continues the climb.  After traveling through the Golden Ridge, Madeline meets up with Theo at a gondola. The reflection appears again and stalls the lift, giving Madeline a panic attack. Theo calms her down, and the gondola moves again, arriving at an ancient temple. Theo ends up separated and trapped inside a mirror. Later, Theo gets encased in a magic crystal and monsters given form from Madeline and Theo’s insecurities attack them. She finds Theo and frees him from the crystal. Madeline then carries Theo out of the temple.  After breaking Theo's crystal and escaping from the temple, Madeline and Theo set up camp. Madeline tells Theo about the reflection and confides in him about her mental health issues before resting. During the night, she seeks out the reflection and expresses her wishes to leave it behind. This angers the reflection, and forces Madeline to plummet down to the base of the mountain. Stuck in a cave at the bottom of the mountain, Madeline meets the old woman again, who suggests that the reflection might be scared and says that Madeline should try talking instead of abandoning it.  Madeline searches for her reflection again, apologizes for pushing it away and vows to climb the mountain together. The reflection initially lashes out at Madeline, but relents and forgives her. The reflection and Madeline merge together, and they work their way back up the mountain, before finally reaching the summit.  An epilogue shows Madeline celebrating her success with her friends by eating strawberry pie. The pie will contain more or less strawberries depending on how many the player collected throughout the game.   In two post-ending chapters, Madeline explores the core of Celeste Mountain a year after the main story in the chapter ""Core"", and copes with missing the funeral of Granny, now known as Celia, in the chapter ""Farewell"".

Players control a single shape at a time, and can move, rotate, and then place it onto a grid. A beatline moves across the grid in time with the music, setting off events when it hits placed shapes. Quads are created by placing shapes in solid blocks of 3x3 or more. When a quad is completed and the beat line hits, different musical samples are triggered dependent on its shape. The size of the quad denotes the score, and multipliers can be achieved by having several quads on the screen at once. Once the beatline hits a completed quad, it is stamped down into the grid, earning the player coverage. (n.b.: when the stage's time runs out, all active quads—those that have not finished filling up—are immediately scored and added to the player's coverage, in order to allow awards of coverage bonus time and continued play.)  The overall objective is to achieve 100% coverage to earn more time and score points.  The game continues as long as time is available; it is possible to complete full coverage of the grid multiple times.  There are two basic modes in the game, Timed Mode and Free Mode. Timed Mode pits the player against the clock, with three different levels of difficulty based on time limit—9, 6, or 3 minutes (the actual play time is longer, depending on the time bonus earned with every 10% coverage gained). Free Mode acts as a very basic sequencer. There is no time limit and the player is able to place shapes at their leisure to create different sounds and alter the music as they see fit.  "

High ratings increase the show's fanbase and revenue, which can be used to improve the studio and upgrade the team's equipment and mecha. The episodes are grouped into seasons and failure to complete the goals set by the sponsors at the end of each season will lead to a game over.  The battles follow the heroes fighting initially in their normal selves, but later gaining the ability to transform, recovering their HP and obtaining special abilities. The ""teamwork"" function allows heroes to help each other during battle, be it reaching longer distances, dealing powerful attacks together, or combining their powers into a special attack that increases ratings when used to destroy the monster of the week.

195,Cities Skylines,/wiki/Cities_Skylines,City building,Colossal Order,Paradox Interactive,"September 14, 2018","September 13, 2018","September 14, 2018"," Players start with a plot of land – equivalent to a 2-by-2-kilometre (1.2 mi × 1.2 mi) area – along with an interchange exit from a nearby highway, as well as a starting amount of in-game money. The player proceeds to add roads and residential, industrial, and commercial zones and basic services like power, water, and sewage as to encourage residents to move in and supply them with jobs.  As the city grows beyond certain population tiers, the player will unlock new city improvements including schools, fire stations, police stations, health care facilities and waste management systems, tax and governing edicts, transit, and other features to manage the city. One such feature enables the player to designate parts of their city as districts. Each district can be configured by the player to restrict the types of developments or enforce specific regulations within the district's bounds, such as only allowing for agricultural industrial sectors, offering free public transportation to residents in the district to reduce traffic, increased tax levels for high commercialized areas, or even with the Green Cities DLC, placing a toll on fossil fuel vehicles entering a district while excluding hybrid and electric vehicles, akin to some forms of congestion pricing.  Buildings in the city have various development levels that are met by improving the local area, with higher levels providing more benefits to the city. For example, a commercial store will increase in level if nearby residents are more educated, which in turn will be able to allow more employees to be hired and increase tax revenue for the city. When the player has accumulated enough residents and money, they can purchase neighbouring plots of land, allowing them to build up eight additional parcels out of 25 within a 10-by-10-kilometre (6.2 mi × 6.2 mi) area. The parcel limitation is to allow the game to run across the widest range of personal computers, but players can use Steam Workshop modifications to open not only all of the game's standard 25-tile building area, but the entire map (81 tiles, 324 square kilometres or 125 square miles).  The game also features a robust transportation system based on Colossal Order's previous Cities in Motion, allowing the player to plan out effective public transportation for the city to reduce traffic. Roads can be built straight or free-form and the grid used for zoning adapts to road shape; cities need not follow a grid plan. Roads of varying widths (up to major freeways) accommodate different traffic volumes, and variant road types (for example, tree-lined roads) offer reduced noise pollution or increased property values in the surrounding area at an increased cost to the player. The road system can be augmented with various forms of public transportation such as buses and subway systems.  Modding, via the addition of user-generated content such as buildings or vehicles, is supported in Cities: Skylines through the Steam Workshop. The creation of an active content-generating community was stated as an explicit design goal. The game includes several premade terrains to build on, and also includes a map editor to allow users to create their own maps, including the use of real-world geographic features. Mods are also available to affect core gameplay elements; prepackaged mods include the ability to bypass the aforementioned population tier unlock system, unlimited funds, and a higher difficulty setting.

196,City of Brass,/wiki/City_of_Brass_(video_game),Dungeon crawler,Uppercut Games,Uppercut Fames,Unreleased,"February 8, 2019","February 8, 2019"," The gameplay video released to coincide with the announcement clearly shows the protagonist wielding a scimitar in the right hand and a whip in the left, and the team confirmed in an interview that the whip contributes to the gameplay in a number of ways: to grab objects, to trip, disarm or stun enemies, shatter barricades, trigger traps and switches and also to swing. Players must make their way through each level within a certain time limit, avoiding being killed by traps or enemies, collecting treasure along the way to increase their scores. Items found in the environment can be used as weapons, for example bricks or vases. As with most dungeon crawlers, death is permanent - players will have to start the game again on each playthrough.  The developers claim that City of Brass gameplay systems are designed to give the player the opportunity to combine them together in imaginative ways to overcome obstacles. Examples given include using the whip to stun an enemy before slicing them with the scimitar, sliding into enemies to push them into a trap, or baiting one enemy such that as it closes in to kill the player, it actually destroys other enemies nearby.  Since entering Early Access, the developers have released 3 updates adding new environments, enemies, weapons, relics and tweaking gameplay balance based on community feedback.  "
197,Civilization VI,/wiki/Civilization_VI,Turn-based strategy,Firaxis Games,2K Games,"November 16, 2018","November 16, 2018","November 16, 2018"," Civilization VI is a turn-based strategy video game in which one or more players compete alongside computer-controlled AI opponents to grow their individual civilization from a small tribe to control of the entire planet across several periods of development. This can be accomplished by achieving one of several victory conditions, all based on the 4X gameplay elements, ""eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate"". Players found cities, gather nearby resources to build and expand them by adding various city improvements, and build military units to explore and attack opposing forces, while managing the technology development, culture, and government civics for their civilization and their diplomatic relationships with the other opponents.  Civilization VI builds upon the general gameplay of Civilization V, including continuing the use of the hex-based grid introduced in Civilization V. New to Civilization VI is the idea of ""city unstacking"": some improvements to cities must be placed in the hexes in the bounds of the city but not within the city's space itself, whereas in previous games, all improvements were considered stacked on the same map hex or square that the city was located in. The player must assign specific hexes as ""districts"" in the city, which have certain limitations but grant bonuses for improvements placed in that district.  For example, the encampment district specializes a city for training military units, and allows for the construction of further buildings that grant production and experience bonuses to said units. Such encampments may not be placed next to the main city center. Other improvements gain bonuses for being placed in appropriate terrain - campuses benefit greatly from being placed adjacent to forest or jungle hexes, reflecting on scientific advance from studying the diversity of species within such biomes. Players can opt to attack specific districts of a city instead of the city center, which can affect the city's operation. These districts may also add new strategies to the city's defense. For example, with a military encampment in place, attacking forces approaching a city are not only subject to ranged attacks from the city center, but also from the encampment. The attacking forces may need to take the encampment first before they can successfully strike the city center.  In order to reduce congestion on the map, players are able to perform a limited amount of unit stacking (a change from Civilization V), but are only able to stack similar unit types or symbiotic units. For example, a warrior unit can be assigned to a builder unit to protect that unit from barbarians in the early game, and a battering ram can stack with a spearman to take over cities.  The game's technology tree, now known as the active research system, has also been modified to help boost technology research if the player has access to appropriate improvements or resources (e.g. building a quarry helps boost the research into masonry). Technologies based on access to water, such as sailing, would be limited if the player started in the middle of a continent. A new feature called Eureka Moments is able to increase the player's progress toward certain technologies after completing specific tasks; for example, laying a mine field contributes to the military tradition technology.  Past iterations of the game were considered difficult to win if the player decided to pursue a Cultural victory. To balance the game toward Cultural victories, a new Civics tree is introduced. The Civics tree has transferred cultural improvements that were previously part of the Technology tree in earlier Civilization games into a separate mechanic. Culture gained from cities is used to build on the Civics tree in the same manner Science from cities builds up the Technology tree. Completing certain Civics will then unlock policies, or policy cards, for the player's government. In Civilization VI, the government is defined by placing appropriate and available policies into a number of slots divided among Military, Economic, Diplomatic, and Wildcard categories. The policies define boosts or limitations for the civilization (e.g. improved attack bonuses for military units against certain types of enemies such as Barbarians). Policies can be changed for free upon completing a single Civic, or for a small cost at any other time, allowing the player to adapt to a new situation as needed, according to lead producer Dennis Shirk.  More advanced cards, only obtainable through significant advancement in the Civics tree, can unlock improvements that give the player pursuing a Cultural victory advantages over other players, such as reducing the time or cost of producing new units. Various choices made by the player may cause unhappiness in their population as with previous games, but in Civilization VI, many of these were localized to the city affected by the choice rather than the entire population, further aiding towards Cultural victory-style players. The Religion system introduced in Civilization V's Gods & Kings expansion is built further upon in VI, featuring more units and improvements that can lead to interreligious conflicts.  AI opponents have new agendas that influence player interactions. Some of these agendas are unique to each leader, emulating notable historical events, respective personalities and policies. Each AI character also has a second hidden agenda, which can only be revealed through espionage.  "

There are six main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, five which are initially available. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player must replay the game multiple times and make different choices to change the plot progression.  When first playing the game, the scenarios for all five heroines and additional smaller scenarios are available in what is called the School Life story arc. When the player completes a character's scenario, he or she receives an orb of light. When eight of these lights are obtained, the game's second story arc, called After Story, is made available. One of the lights disappears during School Life, but reappears in After Story. To view the true ending of Clannad, all 13 lights must be obtained. Originally, the lights were meant to be items that players could use in the game, but since this increased the game's complexity, and detracted from the storyline, the function of the lights was simplified and made less intrusive.

In single-player mode there is a story-driven campaign mode with several scenarios where only 4 characters (Solange, Ali, Zozo and Allegro) are playable, a ""free play"" mode that allows playing any campaign scenario with any available character, and a ""Bonus Quests"" mode where additional scenarios are unlocked and must be beaten with specific requirements.

There is also a multiplayer mode that supports local and network play where players can play several scenarios cooperatively, or they can fight each other in a Versus Mode, up to four combatants in a fight.   In a world populated by humans and monsters, Princess Solange Blanchefleur de Lux is exiled from her home Kingdom of DeLuxia after it is attacked by monsters, and the royal family is blamed for the attack by the Distron army. Armed with the Sacred Blade DeLuxcalibur, Princess Solange sets out to find the cause of the monsters' violent behavior while also avoiding the Distron Army, who are looking for the DeLuxcalibur. On her journey Solange meets several people, including female thief Ali Baba, zombie-like Necromancer Lady Zozo, bard/sage Allegro, martial artist Master T Drakkhen, blind samurai ""Shooting Star"" Tsukikage, business-driven cat Marco Neko, and warrior/nun Sister Helga ""Hel"" Wilhelmina. Zozo, Tsukikage and Master T join Solange because they feel ""drawn"" to the DeLuxcalibur. Zozo also explains that she isn't currently in her real body, but rather created a body for herself because her real body was stolen. Solange and her team eventually learn that Distron's leader Queen Distiny is behind the monster attacks, and then fight the generals of Distron, which include ninja Baku Juppongi, a former acquaintance of Ali; sorcerer Alchemia, and General Liongate, who actually is Solange's brainwashed brother Schwartz.  Solange's team eventually discovers that Queen Distiny is actually a cover identity for fallen angel Dios Diablos Distille, who in the past tried to destroy the world but was defeated, and now was trying to recover her strength to try again to destroy the world. Zozo reveals that her real name is Milk Macchiato and that her body was stolen by Alchemia, who in reality is her sister Cocoa, who had her own body stolen as well, by Queen Distiny. They also learn that Distille's power source is her ""Code"" and the Empyrean Stone, and learn that the gods created the stone and the monsters as means to keep the human population in check, because in the past human civilization grew unchecked and nearly destroyed themselves. Schwartz explains that Solange also has a ""Code"" of her own, the titular Code of Princess, capable of countering Distille's Code.  The team briefly considers destroying the Empyrean Stone but don't do so as it is also the source of the world's magic and the monsters. Solange's team then proceed to confront Distille who reveals that she sealed her ""Code"" in a group of humans (Zozo, Master T and Tsukikage) and lured them to come to her, and that she also needed the DeLuxcalibur to put her Code back together and fully revive. Distille's plan failed, however, because Zozo wasn't in her true body but rather in a corpse constructed from ""spare parts"" animated by magic, and thus she didn't have the full portion of Distille's code sealed into her. A weakened Distille is forced to flee to the Tower of Wrenne, location of the Empyrean Stone, seals herself inside it, and taunts Solange, telling her that she won't dare to destroy the stone as she fully knows the consequences of doing so, and then threatens that she will return in a thousand years at full strength.

213,Contra Anniversary Collection,/wiki/Contra_Anniversary_Collection,Platformer,Konami,Konami,"June 12, 2019","June 11, 2019","June 11, 2019"," Contra is set in the distant future of the year 2633 A.D., when the evil Red Falcon Organization have set a base on the fictional Galuga archipelago near New Zealand in a plot to wipe out humanity. Two commandos, Bill Rizer and Lance Bean of the Earth Marine Corp's Contra unit (an elite group of soldiers specializing in guerrilla warfare), are sent to the island to destroy the enemy forces and uncover the true nature of the alien entity controlling them. The promotional materials for the US arcade version downplays the futuristic setting of the game, with the manual for the later NES and home computer versions changing the game's setting from the future to the present day and the location from Galuga to the Amazon Jungle.   Contra employs a variety of playing perspectives, which include a standard side view, a pseudo-3D view (in which the player proceeds by shooting and moving towards the background, in addition to left or right) and a fixed screen format (in which the player has their gun aimed upwards by default). Up to two people can play simultaneously, with one player as Bill (the blond-haired commando with the white tank top and blue bandana), and the other player as Lance (the shirtless dark-haired commando in the red bandanna). The controls consists of an eight-way joystick and two action buttons for shooting (left) and jumping (right). When one of the protagonists jumps, he curls into a somersault instead of doing a conventional jump like in other games. The joystick controls not only the player's movement while running and jumping, but also his aiming. During side view stages, the player can shoot leftward, rightward or upward while standing, as well as horizontally and diagonally while running. The player can also shoot in any of eight directions, including downwards, while jumping. Pressing the joystick downwards while standing will cause the character to lie down on his stomach, allowing him to avoid enemy fire and shoot low targets. When the jump button is pressed while crouching on a higher platform, the player will drop down to a lower level.  The player's default weapon is a rifle with unlimited ammunition that can be upgraded into one of four other guns. These can be obtained by destroying the pill box sensors and flying item capsules containing them, or by defeating the red-clad guards in the enemy bases. These consist of a machine gun that fires rapidly when the fire button is held down, a laser gun that shoots a powerful beam, a fireball gun that shoots its rounds in a corkscrew pattern, and a spread gun that shoots five individual bullets in individual directions. There are also two auxiliary power-ups that only appear in certain areas when the player is armed with his default gun: a rapid bullets upgrade that increases the firing speed of the player's shots and a barrier that makes him invulnerable for a limited period. With the exception of the machine gun and the laser gun, each item comes in the form of a Falcon-shaped symbol marked with a letter representing its function (F, S, R, and B).  The arcade version of Contra consists of seven stages (the number of stages and level structures varies in later versions). The first stage is a side-scrolling level where the player is dropped into the jungle and must fend off the enemy's initial line of defense until reaching the entrance of the first base, where he must destroy a large sensor to enter the base. The game switches to a 3D view for the second stage, where the player character must fight his way through a series of passageways inside the base before time runs out (a display at the top of the screen shows the map of the base and the time remaining). The player must destroy a generator at the other side of each passageway in order to deactivate the electric current preventing access. The third stage is set in the core of the base in a fixed screen, where the player must destroy the enemy's defense system in order to expose the final target, a giant eyeball that shoots fireballs. Stages 4 through 6 proceed similarly to the first three stages. Stage 4 is a vertically-scrolling level where the player must jump their way to the top of a waterfall until reaching the entrance of the second base, where the player must destroy a large diamond-shaped sensor guarded by a defense system in order to clear the stage. Stage 5 is another 3D stage set inside another base, while Stage 6 is another boss battle, this time against a pair of heads that split into two images each. The heads can only be damaged when their split images aligned together.  The seventh and final stage returns to the side-scrolling format of the first stage, as the player fights his way through the enemy's final line of defense (which includes a hovercraft, armored trucks, and giant helmeted soldiers) while proceeding through areas such as a snowfield, an energy plant and a hangar, until reaching the alien's lair, where the regular enemy soldiers are replaced with otherworldly creatures. The player must fight a giant alien head that spawns larvae from its mouth before reaching the final target, a cardiac creature that must be destroyed in order to complete the mission.  The player loses a life if their character (Bill or Lance) gets touched by enemy or an enemy bullet, fails to complete a base stage before the time limit, or falls into the bottom of the screen when there's no visible platform. When that happens, he will revert to his default weapon on his next life. After losing all lives, the player can continue by inserting more coins (if necessary) and pressing START, but only up to three times. A second player can join-in anytime, but if one player loses all of their lives, they must wait until the other player loses their lives as well to continue together.  The arcade game was released in three versions. The Japanese and American versions are virtually identical, aside from the Japanese version using kanji characters to spell the game's title. However, the European version, titled Gryzor, only allows two players to play the game alternating rather than simultaneously.  "

Certain days may require a minimum point value or specific number of dishes with a specific point value, or feature foods of a specific type or requiring a specific cooking step. After establishing a menu for the day, the food truck sets off for the day, making two or more stops.

Preparing dishes requires a sequence of keyboard-and-mouse or controller actions, itemized on-screen, though with most dishes the customer may wish for custom preparation on their dish (such as condiments on a hamburger) which the player must follow. The player is ranked based on how many orders they serve both in a fixed time period once the order is placed, and to the custom preparation, and penalized for failing to complete orders or for missing key cooking steps like cooking meat. After completing the day, the player is rewarded with in-game currency that can be used to buy new recipes and improved equipment for the truck.   Some gameplay changes are made in Cook, Serve, Delicious! 3 from past titles. With the food truck setting there are no longer any chores that must be completed. The player also has the opportunity to use one of the android drivers to serve off all completed orders while the player completes other orders. Each day can also be run in a ""Chill"" mode, reducing the number and rate of orders to be processed but reducing the potential rewards the player earns from completing a run. In addition to this main campaign mode, the game introduces a ""Zen campaign"" that is less intense in terms of timing demands.  "
219,Cosmic Star Heroine,/wiki/Cosmic_Star_Heroine,Role-playing,Zeboyd Games,Limited Run Games,Unreleased,"August 14, 2018","August 14, 2018"," Cosmic Star Heroine is a role-playing game where the player recruits up to 11 playable characters, and chooses a party of four to go into combat with enemies.  There are no random battles; combat takes place on the field like in Chrono Trigger, with visible enemies and bosses.  These encounters do not respawn, but if a player desires to ""grind"" for more levels and money, they can start additional battles at any time with as a VR battle, somewhat similar to the ability in Cthulhu Saves the World to force an encounter.  Rather than using traditional MP, a unique charge-based system is used.  In battle, each character sets up to 7 abilities and a rest/defend type ability; in general, once an ability is used, it cannot be used again until the defend ability is used, which recharges all spent abilities.  Additionally, each character has a specific pattern for gaining ""Hyper"" turns wherein their abilities are drastically more effective.  This makes it so that ""spamming"" the most powerful ability is less effective due to needing to spend a turn resting to recharge it; the gameplay is based around setting up buffs and debuffs, then using powerful abilities on Hyper turns.  Status effects also operate on a ""reliable"" basis, rather than having a percentage chance of success, but enemies also increase status ailment resistance after being inflicted with an ailment.  Characters, both PCs and enemies, have a Style gauge that starts at 100% and increases with most actions.  Style acts as a multiplier increasing damage done.  Style can be lost via near-death and death, as well as certain powerful ""Burst"" moves that reset Style to 100%.  This acts similar to mechanics in earlier games made by Zeboyd that increase the tension and damage dealt the longer a fight persists.  The game has four difficulty settings which can freely be changed between in-game; enemies are tougher and deal more damage on the higher difficult settings.  The party can explore 3 planets, which contain both towns and dangerous combat-focused areas.  Araenu has a cyberpunk theme, with megacorporations, slums, clubs, and secret bases; Rhomu has a wild-west theme, with saloons, casinos, gunslinging, all underground after war devastated the surface; and Nuluup is a green and verdant planet with mysterious astral powers and a large population of reanimated souls of the dead.  There is a base upgrading system similar to the one from the Suikoden series, in which NPCs can be recruited to join the starship flagship of Alyssa's force.  Some of these NPCs can also offer bonuses and indirect support to the player's party in battle.  There are a variety of sidequests as well, optional content the party can pursue for additional plot scenes and equipment.   The adventure follows Alyssa L'Salle, an agent of the Agency of Peace & Intelligence (API).  An API mission to an abandoned research lab on Rhomu comes into contact with a mission from the rival terrorist organization Astrea; the team investigates and finds the incomplete remnants of a ""Project Lumina"" research project guarded by berserk beasts.  Alyssa's allies discover that Project Lumina seems to be the foundation for a mind control device.  Director Steele, the head of the API, plans on using Lumina to impose order across the galaxy.  Alyssa and her friends defect from the API and seek out the aid of Astrea and its leader, Arete.  Steele's faction of the API attempts to perfect Lumina, while Alyssa and Astrea attempt to gain allies and build a counter-device to protect against Lumina's influence.  Alyssa steals the API's flagship and makes it her own mobile base to investigate a spate of recent incidents: dark energy monsters roaming loose, kidnappings, and mysterious attacks.  Eventually, Alyssa's force defeats Steele, himself driven mad by Lumina's dark influence.  The victory is short-lived; Arete is revealed to also have been under the influence of Lumina's true master the whole time, having subtly influenced her followers to join Astrea, and she combines her own essence of the Lumina with the device recovered from Rhomu to resurrect an ancient evil god.  Alyssa and her party defeat both Arete and the awoken dark god at its alien starship before they can overwhelm the galaxy.  "

Nitro-Fueled featured limited-time Grand Prix events that took place monthly following the game's launch. Each event was accompanied by a free update that added a new race track to the game. Players could compete in special challenges on these new tracks during the event period to earn Nitro Points; by acquiring a certain number of points, they would be able to unlock new characters, karts, and customization items. If players were unable to obtain enough points before the event concluded, the content was made available for purchase in the Pit Stop three months after the event's conclusion.

The main player advances through randomly generated dungeons as a human hero while up to three other spirit players control the dungeon's enemies and traps to kill the main player. The spirit player who kills the human hero swaps roles to become the next main player. Players earn experience as they progress through the dungeon in both the human hero and the non-human spirit roles. Hero experience unlocks new attacks and spells, and spirit experience unlocks stronger enemies to possess. Each player's human hero experience level, weapon, and stats progress is preserved between turns. Crawl was designed to be more fast-paced and arcade-like than strategic, and includes genre-standard activities like collecting loot and upgradable weapons and magic items. Once player spirits possess ""monster spawners"" and traps in the active room, they cannot leave the form until they die or kill the main character. The players and enemies grow progressively more powerful over the course of a match. The game ends when a human hero reaches experience level 10, enters a portal, and defeats a final boss whose limbs are controlled cooperatively by the other players. Typical matches last about 30 minutes.  "

Dr. Jones is able to get a hold of the stone, but disappears and is never found. Half a century later, in 1986, five teenage friends, Chris, Matt, Charlie, Big Joe and Kevin, discover his corpse on a bicycle trip through the woods outside their quiet town in California, and with it also the Duat Stone. Taking the stone home and driven by curiosity, Matt is able to build a device with which the friends are able to unlock and control the stone's power. Though the friends do not fully understand the artifact's power, they find out that it is able to make them see and interact with the spirits of the dead. However, their curiosity gets into the scope of former U.S. Army general Colonel Beringer, self-proclaimed Major Oh Russ, who had organized the Duat Stone's recovery in 1945, and now wants to stop the friends to get deeper into the artifact's power. While the five children go on an epic journey to uncover the secret behind the artifact and the spirits, that are made visible for them, Oh Russ threatens them and captures their parents and friends, to regain the Duat Stone himself and receive the power to control the deceased to accomplish his world invasion plan.   Crossing Souls is built-up around a large, open world, in which the player is set to explore and eventually discover new areas and find clues for their current task from an orthogonal point of view. These tasks are bound to puzzles, which are solved in different ways. One of these ways is dying, meaning that the player switches into the world of the dead using the Duat Stone. The world of the dead gives the player new passages and the ability to interact with the spirits of the dead. Both, dead and alive, will deliver tips and tasks to aid the player in their mission. Another way puzzles are solved is fighting, in which the player gets involved in a combat situation, having to defeat one or multiple enemies to proceed through a guarded passage or acquire a relevant item. Lastly, the player will encounter logic puzzles, which can go from simply pushing an object to figuring out complex switch mechanisms and breaking codes. Each of the five characters has different abilities and weapons, giving the player the task to switch between them and use their specifications to be able to continue or to complete a certain action. At the end of an level, a boss or major personality of the dead will appear, either fighting or guiding the player. In-between levels, the player watches cutscenes designed specifically to look like a TV show from the 1980s, the time in which the game is set.  "
229,Crypt of the NecroDancer,/wiki/Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer,Rhythm,Brace Yourself Games,Brace Yourself Games,"February 1, 2018","February 1, 2018","February 8, 2018"," Crypt of the NecroDancer is a top-down 2D roguelike rhythm game in which the player controls one of a selection of characters to explore several levels of an underground dungeon that are procedurally generated, similar to roguelike games.  Players can manipulate their character by using either a dance pad, a keyboard, or a gamepad. Unlike traditional roguelikes, the player can only have their character move or attack if they perform the action on the beat of the music. As with many rhythm games, each successful beat match boosts a coin scoring multiplier. Failure to match the beat does not directly harm the character in most situations, but does reset the scoring multiplier and may cause the character to be harmed by a nearby monster if they are in their attack path. The character can also be harmed by moving into a monster's attack. When the character's health meter empties, the game is over. Monsters move according to predetermined patterns which the player must learn in order to attack and avoid damage.  As the player explores, they will collect new weapons, armor, usable items, and treasure; the player's inventory is automatically managed by the game. Defeating monsters yields a number of coins that can be used to purchase items from shops within the dungeon. There are also diamonds that are used for purchasing permanent enhancements to the character's abilities in the game's lobby. The dungeon is divided into four zones of four levels each. The first three levels of each zone require the player to find the exit and defeat a mini-boss to unlock it; the fourth level is a larger boss character that must be defeated to progress further. In addition, the player is limited to the length of the song to complete the level; when the song ends, they are automatically sent to the next level through a trapdoor, forgoing the rewards of completing the level.  The player returns to the game's lobby area after dying or optionally at any time, losing any items, gold, or other equipment, though retaining any diamonds they have found. The lobby features shops where the player can spend those diamonds for permanent upgrades before restarting the game or, if they have completed any zones, accessing the next available zone. The player can also access other game modes, such as ""All Zones Mode""  in which the player must make their way through the entire crypt without dying. The player initially has access to the main character, Cadence, but new characters with different modes of play also become available as the player completes certain goals: for example, the monk character receives one free item in each shop, but immediately dies if he touches gold. Special trainers and other beneficial non-player characters can be rescued from certain zones, and once rescued, will provide services to the player from the main lobby, such as letting the player train against enemies and bosses, or providing items that the player can buy with diamonds and use on their next journey into the crypt.  The songs in the game's soundtracks are ordered in ascending tempo across zones and levels, making deeper levels more challenging than earlier ones. The user additionally has the ability to set custom music for each of the game's levels.   In the main game, the player controls Cadence, the daughter of a famed treasure hunter who has gone missing. In searching for him, she falls into a crypt controlled by the NecroDancer, who steals Cadence's heart and forces her to challenge his minions to retrieve it. She is forced to fight through the crypt's dungeon with her actions tied to the beat of the music and her heart, so as to stay alive and defeat the NecroDancer.  Near the heart of the crypt, Cadence finds one of the NecroDancer's minions named ""Dead Ringer"". She defeats him, revealing that it was her missing father and frees him from the NecroDancer's control, allowing him to help her defeat the NecroDancer. They take the NecroDancer's magical golden Lute and use it to kill him, and then use its power to resurrect Cadence's dead mother, Melody. However, they discover that the lute is cursed; Melody must keep playing it forever to sustain her life, but the lute will gradually consume her humanity just as it did to the NecroDancer. Melody enters the crypt in search of answers and a way to break the curse of the lute.  When Melody reaches the end of the crypt, she uses the Golden Lute to resurrect the NecroDancer and find answers, but he attacks and Melody defeats him. The NecroDancer tries to flee, but is cast into a crevice by Aria (Melody's mother) who was lying in a coffin with a dagger in her chest and is brought back to life by the Lute. Aria reveals that she knows how to break the curse of the lute, but was betrayed by the NecroDancer and left for dead. Intending to finish what she started, she begins her ascent out of the crypt in search of a shrine that will destroy the lute once and for all.  When Aria reaches the shrine, she is attacked by the lute itself, which mutates into a large monster in an attempt to save itself from destruction. After defeating the lute's monster form, Aria sacrifices her life to destroy the cursed instrument, returning Melody to full life and allowing her to return to her family, who later bury Aria together.

231,Crystal Crisis,/wiki/Crystal_Crisis,Puzzle,Nicalis,JP,"August 1, 2019","May 28, 2019","May 28, 2019"," The gameplay in Crystal Crisis is heavily inspired by Capcom's Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo. Like Puzzle Fighter, players control sets of two blocks (""crystals"" in game parlance) that fall into a pit-like field (fifteen crystals tall by six crystals wide). Touching a crystal with a Spark Crystal of the same color will cause all adjacent crystals of that color to break and be removed from the field. The more crystals the player is able to break at once or in sequence, the greater number of Countdown Crystals that will appear on an opponent's field, which can only be turned to normal crystals and broken after a certain number of crystals have been dropped. A Poly-Crystal will also appear occasionally, which will instantly break all crystals of whatever color it is dropped on. If the fourth column of a player's field is completely filled, the game ends and that player loses the battle. Unlike Puzzle Fighter, Crystal Crisis features ""edge-wrapping"", allowing crystals to press past the sides of the play field and instantly move from the rightmost column to the leftmost column or vice-versa. This can also be used to bisect a pair of falling crystals, allowing one crystal to fall on each side of the field.  Each character in Crystal Crisis has a unique pattern of Countdown Crystals that they will drop on opponents after performing a crystal break. Breaking crystals will also fill the player's Burst Meter; when filled, the player can activate a Crystal Burst ability. There are two types of Crystal Bursts: an Attack Burst, which can be used to interfere with the opponent's play field, and a Defense Burst, which can be used to assist the player with clearing their own field. The effects of each Crystal Burst vary based on the player's chosen character; for example, Astro Boy's Attack Burst shifts all of the opponent's crystals to the right, while his Defense Burst allows the player to rotate clusters of four crystals on their field. Some characters' Burst Meters can store up to three levels of power, with the effectiveness of the Crystal Burst being increased the more of their meter they spend at once, while others can only use their Crystal Burst by expending their entire meter.  Crystal Crisis offers a single-player story mode, in which the power of the Red Crystal from Cave Story causes the boundaries between worlds to break down, and various heroes race to find and destroy the crystal before a group of villains can use it for their own evil purposes. Each battle in the story mode allows players to choose between one of two predetermined playable characters, with branching progression based on which characters they choose for each battle, though every route culminates in a battle with the game's final boss, the Undead Core from Cave Story. The game also features single-player arcade and survival modes, a training mode, and both local and online multiplayer battles. Several alternate play styles are available as well, including ""Inline"", which removes Spark Crystals and functions similarly to a ""match-three"" puzzle game; ""Tag Team"", which allows players to switch between two characters in the middle of a battle; and ""Memory"", which turns all crystals black as soon as they are dropped and challenges players to remember their colors. Additionally, the game features accessibility options for colorblind players, including the ability to set custom colors for each of the four crystals.  "

Each of these boss fights and run-and-gun levels is housed in three different worlds, with the final one being against the Devil himself. The game also includes role-playing elements and a branching level sequence. Cuphead has infinite lives, maintaining all equipment between deaths. The player can purchase weapons and ""Charms"" (special abilities) from the shop using coins collected from the run-and-gun levels. Player characters feature a parry attack that can be used on certain objects marked in pink, to various effects, the most important of them being increasing a ""super meter"" that enables more powerful attacks.  After completing a level, the player is ranked with a grade based on their performance on factors such as the time taken to defeat a boss, damage avoided, and number of parried attacks. The levels are accessible through a top-down perspective overworld with its own secret areas. The game also has a two-player local cooperative mode.   On the fictional Inkwell Isles, Cuphead and his brother, Mugman, are two fun-loving cups who live under the watchful eye of Elder Kettle. Against the elder's warnings, the brothers enter the Devil's Casino and begin playing craps. When they go on a winning streak, the Devil himself offers to raise the stakes. If Cuphead and Mugman can win one more roll, they will receive all the money in the casino; if not, the Devil will take their souls. Cuphead loses by rolling snake eyes, and he and Mugman beg for mercy. The Devil makes a deal with them: Collect the ""soul contracts"" that signify his ownership of the souls of his runaway debtors by midnight the next day, and he might let them keep theirs. They visit Elder Kettle, who gives them a potion that allows them to fire blasts from their fingers to aid in their quest, but also warns them that the debtors may change physical form in an effort to stop them.  The brothers travel around the Inkwell Isles, fighting the debtors in order to obtain their contracts. On entering the second island, the Elder Kettle notices that the duo are getting stronger from their battles, and informs them about ""doing the right thing"" when they come up against the Devil again. Once they have the contracts, they return to the Devil's Casino, but its manager, King Dice, blocks their way. He has lost a bet with the Devil, presumably over whether Cuphead and Mugman would be able to complete their task, and forces them to fight his own henchmen before confronting them directly. After the brothers defeat King Dice, the player must choose whether to give the contracts to the Devil. If the player turns over the contracts, the Devil turns the brothers into his evil lackeys, and the game ends; if not, the Devil becomes furious at the brothers' refusal to honor their deal and fights them himself. Cuphead and Mugman triumph over him, burn the contracts and race home. Learning that they no longer have anything to fear from the Devil, the former debtors honor the brothers for their heroic actions.  "

Each note provides a score based on its accuracy, which can be ""Perfect"", ""Good"", ""Bad"" or ""Miss!"". Hitting consecutive notes in a row with either a ""Good"" or ""Perfect"" rating will result in a combo, which provides a score boost that increases as the combo rises. At the end of a song, the player is given a score out of 1,000,000, with a minimum of 700,000 required to clear it.

A French company called Genoq has developed a series of new genetically engineered bioweapons, which have run out of control and taken over Genoq's Singaporean lab. The main character is a courier making an emergency delivery by jetpack of an important package to one of Genoq's top researchers, Jean-Paul Derrida (a name likely inspired by the philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and Jacques Derrida), and who is happily oblivious to the carnage until the lab's doors lock behind him. His customer is ten floors away, all of them crawling with bioweapons.   The game presents an isometric point of view of different interconnected, mazelike rooms that the player passes through floor by floor. Each room can require brains, brawn or both. All bioweapons present in a room must be killed and all air duct vents that they enter through sealed before proceeding further. The building's paranoid security system has predictably gone haywire, leaving rotating grenade launcher turrets, land mines, electrified floors and laser fences targeting humans. Less hostile puzzle elements are doors, the switches and computers that control them, keycards, infrared electric eyes and teleporters.  The courier is soon armed with a laser gun that holds unlimited ammunition and a great puzzle value: its shots bounce off walls, trip switches and travel in teleporters. Finally, surviving Genoq employees and some special items are scattered around the floors. Rescuing a survivor by clearing a room of bioweapons and getting him/her to its entry point in one piece earns an extra life. Bombs are the most prominent item; they can blast through doors and destroy some hazards, making them a kind of a ""get out of puzzle free"" coupon.  The number of lives is limited. Losing one restarts the room if any are left, the floor if not. Saving is available, loading returns to the start of the floor.  "

Initially, the player can only light and tend a fire in the room. As the game progresses, the player gains the abilities to collect resources, interact with strangers, start a village, and explore the world. As the game progresses, the type and quantity of resources and exploration available increases. According to The New Yorker, ""What follows is a strange hybrid, part mystery story and part smartphone productivity software...the game evokes the simplest text-based computer games of the nineteen-seventies while stimulating a very modern impulse to constantly check and recheck one's phone. It's like a puzzle composed of deconstructed to-do lists."" The site added, ""You can begin to see a structure emerge from the fragments, but where that structure will lead you remains impossible to predict, and so the compulsion to keep pressing little word buttons grows stronger.""   The game begins with the player character lighting a fire in a dark room. Shortly afterwards, a woman stumbles into the room and collapses. Struggling to sleep and beset by ""voices"", the player character starts to collect resources from a nearby forest to calm down. Eventually, the woman comes to her senses and reveals that she is a builder who can aid the player character. The builder helps the player character establish a village for wanderers to settle in. The villagers help gather resources, but the player character overworks them until they essentially become slaves. At some point, the player character's intense wanderlust causes them to acquire a compass and explore the area outside of the village. The player character emerges into a post-apocalyptic wasteland full of decrepit ruins and hostile enemies. If the player character dies while exploring, they awaken in the village, seemingly revived by the builder with the aid of a glowing locket around her neck. While exploring the wasteland, the player character discovers an abandoned ""wanderer"" spaceship and brings it back to the village. Eventually, the builder, disgusted by the player character's mistreatment of the villagers and violent actions in the wasteland, suddenly vanishes, leaving her locket behind. In the wasteland, the player character can encounter an old wanderer, who discusses his past as an admiral in a space fleet that devastated numerous planets. Ultimately, it is revealed to the player through numerous clues that ""wanderers"" are actually a race of extraterrestrial beings who invade planets and leave them in ruins. The player character, who is a wanderer, uses the spaceship to head into outer space, looking for the builder.  "
245,Dark Souls Remastered,/wiki/Dark_Souls_Remastered,Action role-playing,FromSoftware,Bandai Namco Entertainment,"October 19, 2018","October 19, 2018","October 19, 2018"," Dark Souls is a third-person action role-playing game. A core mechanic of the game is exploration. Players are encouraged by the game to proceed with caution, learn from past mistakes, or find alternative areas to explore. Dark Souls takes place in a large and continuous open world environment, connected through a central hub area. The player character can travel between areas and explore various paths at will, although prerequisites have to be met to unlock certain areas.   A central element to the gameplay of Dark Souls is the bonfire. Bonfires are scattered throughout the world and serve as checkpoints for each level. By resting at a bonfire, the player character is healed to full and regains all of the healing charges of their ""Estus Flask."" They can also level up and perform other functions, such as attuning magic, and repairing and upgrading equipment. However, resting at a bonfire respawns all of the world's enemies, except for bosses, mini-bosses, and friendly non-playable characters.  The player character's interaction with the world of Dark Souls includes a great deal of combat. Combat includes melee attacks, various forms of defensive maneuvering, and magical abilities. For melee attacks, player characters have access to a wide array of high fantasy, medieval-style weaponry—including swords, spears, maces, and more—as well as imaginary, fantastical weaponry—including magical swords, humongous greatswords, and immense clubs. For defense, player characters have access to shields, armor, dodge rolling, and parrying. For magic, which includes a wide variety of offensive and defensive abilities known as sorceries, miracles, and pyromancies, player characters do not use any form of mana as in most other fantasy RPGs - instead, they gain a discrete number of uses for each attuned spell when resting at a bonfire. These various forms of combat all have tradeoffs, variations, and in-game costs associated with them; and they can all be buffed or altered in some fashion through leveling, smithing, consumable items, magical rings, and new equipment.

247,Darkest Dungeon,/wiki/Darkest_Dungeon,Tactical role-playing,Red Hook Studios,Red Hook Studios,"August 9, 2018","January 18, 2018","January 18, 2018"," At the outset of Darkest Dungeon, the player learns that they have inherited an estate from a relative who, while seeking fame and fortune by excavating the dungeons and catacombs beneath his manor, has unearthed portals to dark dimensions and released a number of horrific and evil creatures onto the world. As the current owner of the estate and the surrounding lands, the player must recruit a roster of adventurers and mount expeditions to cleanse the estate of its vile inhabitants.  As the player ventures into the manor, the dungeons below it, and the surrounding lands, they find their relative's memoirs telling of the terrible deeds he had done in pursuit of knowledge and power. Eventually, the player is able to send a party into the titular Darkest Dungeon, the source of the land's corruption, taking steps to reveal its ultimate form. Within the deepest chamber, the player encounters the disembodied spirit of their ancestor, who now remains as ""an Avatar of the Crawling Chaos."" After defeating the ancestor's apparition, the party battles the Heart of Darkness - revealed to be the progenitor of all life on the planet. The party manages to defeat its physical form at great cost, but the ancestor's spirit reveals to the player that this has only delayed its inevitable awakening and, by extension, the end of the world. The ancestor explains that this is merely part of an endless cycle in the player's lineage and that the player will eventually meet the same fate as he, and their descendants onward. The ancestor then accentuates this cycle by repeating his first words from the start of the game: ""Ruin has come to our family.""   Darkest Dungeon is a role-playing game in which the player manages a roster of heroes and adventurers to explore these dungeons and fight the creatures within. Prior to entering a dungeon, the player can use facilities in a town near the mansion to dismiss or recruit more heroes, send heroes to perform various activities that will heal them, gain new combat or camping skills, reduce their stress, or remove any afflictions that they incurred while in a dungeon, and buy and sell equipment and supplies to outfit their heroes, using money and loot gained during dungeon runs. Many of these facilities can also be improved to add more benefits or options to the player. The player can recruit up to 28 (or 30 on easiest difficulty) heroes on their roster once the stagecoach has been fully upgraded; each hero belongs to one of fifteen character classes, and has their own statistics and skills that can be upgraded over time. If a hero dies while exploring a dungeon, that hero is lost for good.  Once the player has completed preparations, they select four of their heroes to go explore a dungeon. Access to most dungeons requires completing several previous dungeons and collecting specific types of loot, with such later dungeons being more difficult than the earlier ones. Dungeons are procedurally-generated in a roguelike manner and presented as a series of interconnected rooms with hallways between each. The parties move between rooms in a real-time, side-scrolling view, with the potential to discover interesting objects to search or random combat encounters during this time. When the party reaches a room, they may be forced into combat, but once clear the room remains a safe zone allowing the player to apply healing and other remedies to the party. When combat occurs, it plays out in a turn-based manner, with each character having their own order based on an initiative that changes each turn. Heroes can use attacks, magic, special skills, or items during their turn to defeat the other party. The order which the party moves through the passages and rooms is critical as it affects who may interact with various items, and the available actions that a character can do while in combat; for example, a swordsman in the back of the party cannot easily attack, while range-attack characters like archers and mages can. The positions of heroes can be changed around, but this can consume time or a combat turn. While each dungeon has a target goal, the player can opt to leave the dungeon at any time, retaining all loot collected but forgoing the larger reward for clearing out the dungeon and massively increasing the stress of every hero within the party.  A core element of Darkest Dungeon is its Affliction system, a concept of a hero's stress level or resolve. Though a hero will have little stress when they are hired, it will worsen from a number of factors encountered while in a dungeon, such as adventuring without food or light sources, seeing the death or wounding of a fellow party member in battle, or from blights cast on them by enemies. If the hero's high stress remains unchecked, they may develop afflictions that will interfere with the behavior of the character, such as being frightened and unable to fight directly. Less frequently, a stressed character may develop virtues that enhance their attributes, such as becoming more invigorated within battle. Some afflictions, left unchecked, may become permanent quirks that remain on the character. Other afflictions can be removed back in the village and by performing special activities, such as drinking at a bar or repenting at a church, that occupy the character's time, preventing them from being part of a dungeon party.  Allowing a hero to reach an extremely high stress level can cause them to have a heart attack, bringing them to the brink of death if not immediately tended to.  Stress can be lowered while in a dungeon through camping offered at specific locations, or other restorative items, as well as when back in the nearby town. While camping, the characters will have another set of available skills that can be used to help relieve stress and help with other party members.  There are two other game modes aside from Darkest mode, which is the ""Normal"" mode for Darkest Dungeon. The first is Radiant mode, designed to reduce the length of time to complete the campaign without compromising the core difficulty with the game. In Radiant mode, level limitations are less strict, the player gets to recruit stronger heroes and hero XP gain is accelerated. The second mode is the Stygian mode, which is a much more difficult and challenging mode. Stygian mode not only has enemies with increased health and damage and an increase in light depletion but a failure condition. Should the player fail to complete the game within 86 in-game weeks or have 12 or more heroes killed, the 'Thing' will be awoken causing a game over and the save file to be deleted. Also note that Radiant and Darkest mode give the player the option to toggle off gameplay features that increase the game difficulty, whereas the player cannot toggle these in Stygian mode.  "

The Charred council suspects that the demon king Lucifer is planning something with Samael to upset the balance and orders War and Strife to investigate. After invading Samael's keep, they find it under attack from another master of hell, albeit a lesser one, Moloch. Samael informs them that he is not in league with Lucifer and the current attack on him is the result of that. Before he can say anything else, Moloch attacks and Samael teleports the horsemen to the void to find and talk to his associate. The horsemen track through the void and finds Vulgrim to be the associate Samael spoke of. Vulgrim informs them he can help track down Lucifer but he needs several artifacts. After collecting those required artifacts Vulgrim informs them that Lucifer has paid a visit to Mammon, a hell's master. Samael comes to void and suggests that the horsemen find Mammon and make him talk about Lucifer. They find Mammon with several relics and weapons from Eden. After killing him, the horsemen come back to Vulgrim and Samael where they learn that Lucifer has opened a path to Eden and bringing the sacred water and turning it to poison. The demon Belial is in charge of this operation. After stopping the operation, they confront Belial but spares him. But after the horsemen leave, Lucifer comes and kills him. The horsemen learn that Dagon, the drowned king is also being helped by Lucifer to cleanse Eden as Lucifer has offered him Eden.  Meanwhile, they meet Abaddon, the guardian angel of Eden. He informs them that Lucifer is spreading corruption and asks them to help him cleanse the corruption from Eden. Afterwards the horsemen track down and kills Dagon. They return to the void and Lucifer advises them to destroy the source of Moloch’s power before they attack him. They do so and together with Samael, they attack and kill Moloch. However, before his death, Moloch tells them that Lucifer’s plan is complete and Samael knows about it. After returning to the void, Samael tells the horsemen that the Lucifer asked for the souls of the masters of hell after their death in exchange for their services. Samael also tells them that Lilith is also plotting with Lucifer and together they have made an artifact called the “Animus” which is fueled by the souls of the masters of the hell. This artifact is used on earth to corrupt the mankind. The horsemen go to earth to find the mankind living in sin and realize that they have helped Lucifer achieve his goal. Lucifer talks to them through a human child and tells the horsemen that corruption of the humankind is spreading and it will continue. After they come back to the Charred council as the council declares that humankind needs to be watched as a third kingdom. They then forge the seven seals as a treaty to uphold the balance between heaven and hell. Three of them comes from the demons and three comes from the angels and one is from the council. They declare whoever breaks the treaty shall suffer the wrath of The Horsemen, setting the stage for the future games.   Played from a top-down perspective, the game allows players to switch between Strife and War at any time. Strife uses his pistols, Mercy and Redemption while War uses his sword, Chaos Eater. Alternatively, two players can play the game in a co-op mode with each player taking the role of one of the characters. Once the player has killed enough enemies, they are allowed to use burst abilities which allow them to take down enemies quicker. The game currency is souls which can be earned by killing enemies that will spawn before the player. Platforming elements similar to previous games make a return and certain gameplay mechanics such as bombs are present too.  "
252,Darkwood,/wiki/Darkwood,Survival horror,Acid Wizard Studio,Crunching Koalas,Unreleased,"May 16, 2019","May 16, 2019"," The game features a semi-open world, with the player unlocking new areas as the storyline progresses. It also features a crafting system, a day/night cycle, trading and non-player character (NPC) interaction, a skill system, stealth and combat, as well as multiple storyline branches which alter several aspects of the world.  During daytime, the player can explore the world and scavenge for supplies at several locations scattered around each biome, the player may also spend this time repairing doors or barricades around the hideout and crafting new items and upgrades at the workbench. During the day the player can also ""cook"" certain items at his stove in order to gain access to various skills, any beneficial skill that the player chooses requires a detrimental skill to also be chosen. During the night the player cannot leave the hideout and must defend against possible intruders until morning. Planning a defensive strategy is key and players have the opportunity to lay traps and barricade doors or windows to slow down any intruders.  Should the player survive the night, they will gain reputation with the trader which can be used to trade for more expensive items. If the player dies during the night, they will wake up in the next morning without receiving any bonuses. Should the player die while out scavenging, they will suffer a loss of half their inventory which is then marked on the map for later collection. Higher difficulties have higher penalties for death such as the loss of lives or permanent death.   The storyline is shaped based on how the player reacts to the requests and actions of NPCs. Aiding different ones will lead to different endings, and sometimes influences sub-plots relating to several other NPCs. The game switches to a different map in its second chapter, with the previous regions becoming locked and several new gameplay elements and NPCs being introduced. Different characters from the first chapter may appear too, depending on the player's actions. The game features two different main endings, with each character's subplot being defined by other, smaller actions as well as which of these endings the player has achieved.  "

Players take on the role of Slayers to take down Behemoths, collecting loot that they use to craft and upgrade weapons and equipment as to take down larger and more powerful Behemoths. While hunting, the game plays as a third-person action game; the player uses a combo system to attack the creature, while monitoring their own health and stamina gauge.

Players choose their character's faction (Hero or Villain), gender (male or female), body type (short, medium, tall, spry, athletic, large), personality (comical, flirty, powerful, primal, serious), movement mode (flight, acrobatics, speed or skimming), weapon, and power (fire, ice, gadgets, mental, nature, sorcery, earth, light, electricity, rage, quantum, celestial, munitions, atomic, and water). Numerous hair, skin, and costume types are available, and up to 4 colors can be applied to the color scheme palette. Pre-built templates, inspired by some key DC characters, are available to expedite the character creation process.  When the player's character is named, they are thrown into the world of DC Universe Online with the first experience having to fight their way out of a spaceship. The tutorial teaches basic movement and abilities, counter mechanics, and using power and skill points. Eventually the player's character is made an official member of the Justice League (heroes) or The Society (villains), where they continue on their missions to increase their level and skill in various content. Daybreak Game Company is working to make DC Universe Online more interactive than standard MMO games, while trying to keep their key elements which include a leveling system, raid instances, endgame progression and inventories. The world is mainly a shared, public space. The public space features dynamically-generated content designed for both hero and villain player characters to progress and fight alongside and against a multitude of iconic DC Comics characters, moving forward with stories, many of which are brought forth from the pages of DC comics.  DC Universe Online has been actively updating through Game Updates (GU) and Hotfixes. Aside from bug fixes, several Game Updates involve Seasonal Events which provide special feats, styles, base items, overworld missions and instances exclusive to the time frame it runs for, usually a month. There are three Events that tend to cycle throughout the year: Survival Mode, Legends PvE and Stabilizer Fragment Instances. DC Universe Online offers downloadable content (DLC) called Episodes which expand the game universe with new, more difficult missions to progress that provide new or continuations of stories already existing; new costume styles and equipment.   The opening cinematic takes place in a gritty, war-torn future depicting a final battle between the world's greatest heroes and villains. A future version of Lex Luthor provides voice-over narration. This battle takes place in the ruins of Metropolis. Lex Luthor, wearing a heavy mech armor, commands an army of super-villains that includes Joker, Harley Quinn, Circe, Deathstroke, Black Adam, Giganta, Metallo and Poison Ivy. A scarred, armored Batman commands the heroes, which includes Cyborg, Flash, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and Green Arrow. Both Poison Ivy and Green Arrow are shown dead at the beginning of the cutscene. The battle culminates with the death of Wonder Woman at Luthor's hands, at which point an unshaven, weary Superman hears her dying screams from orbit and flies to Earth to confront him. As Superman cradles Wonder Woman's dead body, he collapses to the ground and it is revealed that Luthor hid Kryptonite pellets in her mouth as a trap. Luthor impales Superman with a kryptonite-tipped spear, and stands back to proclaim his victory only to see Brainiac's war fleet fill the skies.  The scene then shifts to the present-day Watchtower, where the future Lex Luthor, heavily modified with Brainiac technology, is telling the story to the present-day Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. Future Luthor explains that the deadly final war between the heroes and villains was triggered by the subtle manipulations of Brainiac (who had been slowly downloading their powers over time). With the planet's most powerful beings dead, Brainiac intended to use the pirated data to create an army of metahumans under his control, facilitating his conquest of Earth. As the sole survivor of the war, Luthor could do nothing to resist Brainiac's subjugation of the planet. Luthor explains that he was able to survive in secret and eventually steal the stolen data and energy from Brainiac's mothership in the form of ""exobytes"" (nanobot-sized devices that can bond to a living host and give them their own superpowers). Luthor has traveled into his past to release the exobytes into the atmosphere of present-day Earth. The heroes are outraged, but Luthor explains that because he has done this, soon thousands of new metahumans will be created from ordinary humans (becoming the player-characters of the game). He implores the Justice League to find and train these new metahumans, because Brainiac is coming and the Earth must be ready to succeed where it was once doomed to fail.  When this cinematic ends, the player is brought to the character creation menu to build their new Hero or Villain.  In the second trailer to the game ""In Lex we Trust"", it is revealed that Lex Luthor's description of events leading up to his arrival in the present time is not as he described to the heroes. The trailer begins with Luthor reviving his companion Fracture from being unconscious. Luthor explains that Brainiac's forces have already penetrated the Fortress of Solitude and that their time is running out. As they approach a time portal chamber, a Brainiac Eradicator attacks and Fracture destroys the robotic drone with a small grenade. The two arrive at the portal which is being stabilized by Batman (whose face is disfigured and arm is replaced by a robotic prosthetic due to injuries from the battle of villains and heroes). As more Eradicators enter the chamber, Luthor lies saying his armor is damaged and that he can not hold them off. Batman tells Fracture to take the canister that contains millions of exobytes and go through the portal, while attacking the Eradicators in order to buy him more time. Fracture thanks Luthor for using the exobytes to give him his powers. Seeing the opportunity he had been waiting for, Luthor kills Fracture describing him as ""an excellent lab rat."" Before Luthor steps into the portal, Batman calls to Luthor warning that ""I'll be coming for you"" to which Luthor responds ""No, you won't"" and activates a self-destruct sequence. Luthor enters the portal and the Fortress of Solitude suffers massive explosions. He arrives in a dark alley, presumably present day. He is greeted by his present-day self who describes him as being late.  It is then shown at the end of ""The Prime Battleground"" raid that Future Lex Luthor and Lex Luthor are working together to steal Brainiac's power. Luthor is then betrayed by his future self as Future Luthor wants the power for himself. It is then shown that Future Batman survived the explosion at the Fortress of Solitude and has been chasing Future Luthor through time. Future Luthor escapes and Future Batman follows him. In the following cutscene, Future Batman is said to be the last hope for humanity.  Following these events, the heroes are led by Future Batman while villains are led by Future Luthor to the ""Nexus of Reality"" (the center of the Multiverse itself). Both sides fight for control, using paradoxes from constant time-travels to alter the histories of iconic characters, forcing heroes and villains to work parallel to each other, changing the timelines in the same fashion. What one causes, the other reverts, thus making an infinite cycle. This results in a massive paradox creature that consumes time itself. In the raid, players must stop the creature from destroying the time-space continuum (one of the many raids where both villains and heroes have the same goal). This event ends the storyline the game was based upon, yet also opens up the possibility to enter many new realities.  Since then, there have been certain stories tied in reflecting the Arrowverse, with the introduction of Nanda Parbat, fighting alongside characters featured in Legends of Tomorrow, and a Supergirl Costume Legends character. Content from the DC Extended Universe has also been released. Other comic centered storylines feature ""Sons of Trigon"", ""Blackest Night"", ""Amazon Fury"", ""Halls of Power"", ""Bombshells Paradox"", ""Bottle City of Kandor"", ""Harley Quinn"", ""Earth 3"", ""Teen Titans: The Judas Contract"", ""Justice League Dark"", ""Dark Nights: Metal"" and Birds of Prey in Episodes.

255,De Blob,/wiki/De_Blob,Platform,BlitWorks,THQ Nordic,"December 20, 2018","June 26, 2018","June 26, 2018"," The player character — de Blob — starts out as a ball of clear ""water"". de Blob is free to roll around and collect paint from Paintbots in the three colors of red, yellow and blue, which can be combined into green, orange, purple and brown. de Blob then merely has to touch a building, lamppost, billboard, or other object for the entire surface of said object to be smeared in his current color. As he colors the city, the game's soundtrack, featuring live bands which recorded slow and fast versions of each ""lick"" (each hit), gradually adds more instrumentation as well as an additional ""layer"" of sound corresponding to de Blob's current color—being red usually adds a saxophone solo to the music, for example. As de Blob collects paint, his size increases to a maximum of 100; each object he paints costs a paint point, as does attacking enemies, while touching water makes de Blob remove his color.  While de Blob is free to paint, there are various missions which can or must be completed. These missions are given by various members of the Color Underground and include painting certain buildings certain colours and transforming a landmark with enough of a certain color of paint (for example, 30 yellow paint points). Each of the 10 levels have a main landmark to paint, which may require more than one color and more paint points than usual.  There are various hazards to avoid, however. Pools of ink turn de Blob black and cause him to lose paint points constantly; when he loses all of his paint points, he loses a life. Ink must be washed out with water. The INKT forces, Inkies, will send out foot soldiers to stop de Blob, as well as other forces—handheld ink guns, turrets, tanks, jetbikes and even Inkies that are immune to all but a specific color. There are also other hazards, such as hotplates, electric plates and spikes.  As de Blob paints Chroma City and completes missions, points are accumulated. Each gate separating the player from the next part of a stage can be opened by reaching a certain number of points. Once the final gate is open, the stage can be completed.   Told through a combination of pre-rendered cinematic sequences and in-game dialog, de Blob tells the story of Chroma City, its invasion by the INKT Corporation and its subsequent liberation by the titular Blob and the Color Underground.  Initially a lively and colorful city populated by its equally colorful and diverse citizens, the Raydians, Chroma City is suddenly invaded by the INKT Corporation. A corporate military dictatorship, INKT is led by the villainous Comrade Black and dedicated to the eradication of color through its ""War on Color"". Chroma City quickly falls to the invading army of Inkies and color-draining Leechbots, leaving its landscape barren, its flora withered and its fauna in hiding. The citizens are rounded up and turned into ""Graydians"", encased in homogeneous gray prison suits distinguished only by a bar code on the back of each shell. The Graydians are forced to serve as both menial labor and as a living resource of ink, the latter of which is mined literally from their sadness.  Blob witnesses the takeover of Chroma City from his jungle retreat and goes into action, first rescuing the only remaining pocket of resistance, the Color Underground. Blob joins the group, and under their orders, begins to win back sections of the city and arouse the vicious ire of Comrade Black. In response, Black orders everything from propaganda campaigns to the creation of super soldiers in an attempt to stop Blob, though to no avail.  With nearly all of Chroma City in control of the Color Underground, Comrade Black desperately orders all his troops to retreat to his spaceship in Lake Raydia, and attempts to launch all the stolen color into a black hole where it will be lost forever. However, Blob manages to stowaway onto the spaceship and defeat Black, then detonates a device that devours the spacecraft in a burst of color and whimsy.  With the Raydians finally safe, Blob returns to his jungle retreat, napping on a tree as he was at the story's beginning.  "
256,De Blob 2,/wiki/De_Blob_2,Platform,BlitWorks,THQ Nordic,"February 21, 2019","August 28, 2018","August 28, 2018","  de Blob 2's gameplay is largely similar to its predecessor's. The player once again controls Blob, who can mix colors in order to paint objects and bring life to the cityscape, which in turn opens up previously locked areas. Blob is given missions by his friends in the Color Underground, such as completing timed races, defeating enemies, liberating captured Graydians and seizing important landmarks.  However, new gameplay additions have been added. One example is Blob's new ability to perform a powerful dash attack, which breaks through obstacles and kills most foes, at the expense of a sizable amount of paint points. Furthermore, as the player progresses through the game, they obtain ""inspiration points"", which are used at the Idea Emporium to purchase upgrades for Blob, such as increased paint capacity and defensive shields. Power-ups feature within the levels as well: the magnetic Wrecking Ball allows Blob to roll up metal surfaces, sink underwater, and destroy any enemy easily; the Hazmat Suit protects Blob from any passive hazards such an ink and hotplates; the Graviton Bomb temporarily transforms Blob into a devastating black hole; the Re-Gen constantly replenishes Blob's paint points; and the Rainbow gives Blob infinite paint points and gives him the use of all seven colors at once.  Another new inclusion is a two-player mode akin to the co-op functionality of Super Mario Galaxy. The second player takes control of a new member of the Color Underground named Pinky, who is able to assist Blob and help him surmount more difficult challenges. Bosses also play a larger role in this game; the player has to use the painting mechanics in thoughtful ways in order to defeat them.  Aside from the new gameplay additions, de Blob 2 also has a heavier emphasis on platforming compared to its predecessor. Much like in de Blob, Blob has to take over landmark buildings in the city, but this time he also has to enter them, rather than simply needing a certain amount of paint points to capture it. Inside, the gameplay switches from its usual 3D perspective to a 2D perspective. Blob must then complete a platforming challenge filled with many hazards, such as the new Gravity Wall mechanics, before the building is taken. There are over 100 of these platforming stages throughout the course of the game.  In comparison to the home console versions, the Nintendo DS version of de Blob 2 instead plays entirely as a 2D platformer. It is divided into individual levels that require Blob to make use of wall jumping and a slingshot technique to traverse environments, with these features drawing comparisons to the gameplay used in the Sonic the Hedgehog series.

The player controls a mass of cells that occupy and control the body of a deceased prisoner at the start of each game. As they explore a series of dungeons and fight the creatures within, they collect weapons, skins, abilities, power-ups, and money. Some enemies will also drop cells when defeated, which can be used to obtain permanent power-ups such as additional health potions or new items that can be bought or found in later runs. These cells can only be spent at the end of a dungeon section, though players can also choose not to spend them; if a player dies before then, they lose all collected cells.  Each level is procedurally generated by merging of predesigned sections in a random configuration along with random placement of enemies and items. The game's combat is said to be similar to the Souls series, with difficult enemies with certain behaviors the player can learn, and where frequent player-character death is a fundamental part of the game. At intervals throughout the game, the player must also defeat boss enemies known as ""Keepers"". There are six Keepers in the game—The Concierge, Conjonctivious, The Time Keeper, The Giant, The Hand of the King, and The Collector.  The game includes Twitch integration, allowing viewers, via the stream's chat, to influence the game, such as voting for which upgrade paths the player should take.   "
259,Dead by Daylight,/wiki/Dead_by_Daylight,Survival horror,Behaviour Interactive,Starbreeze Studios,"September 26, 2019","September 24, 2019","September 24, 2019"," A group of up to four survivors must elude one killer. The survivors' perspectives are third-person, while the killer's perspective is first-person. The survivors cannot fight against the killer and can only survive by running away and evading them. They must use obstacles in the form of wooden pallets, windows, and items that they either find inside chests or bring before the match starts to run from the killer for as long as they can. In order to escape, survivors must repair 5 generators scattered across the entire map to power the exit gates, then they must open the exit gates and leave the area themselves or find a hatch to jump into.    The Entity, a supernatural being hailing from the ancient blood web, is awakened from its slumber and summoned by actions of great violence and malice. The killers, mostly serial murderers, or victims of terrible tragedy, are pulled out of reality by it and convinced or forced to do its bidding. In order to maintain its existence, the Entity requires sacrifices, and demands that they hunt and kill the survivors so it can feed off their hope and steal a piece of their souls upon death. In order to continue this hunt, The Entity blocks off the Gateways of death and puts the dead into a dreamlike state that leads the survivors back to The Entity's world to get hunted again.  The survivors are pulled into the Entity's constructed world when they wander too close to the places the killers were taken from, disappearing from the real world without a trace. They end up at a lonely campfire, where they rest between trials, until a killer pursues them again. Each trial takes place in a series of realms constructed by the Entity of areas from where the killers were taken. The survivors' only hope of escape is to complete a series of generators scattered throughout each realm to power up large gates to escape. If the killer has killed all but one survivor, the Entity will offer the latter a final means of escape in the form of a hatch. Escaping from the grounds always takes the survivors back to the campfire, and offerings can be created to be burnt at it and appeal for the Entity's favour. Since the Entity feeds off the hope of the survivors to escape, it helps them just as much as the killers, acting as an impartial observer of the hunt, stepping in only to claim those hung on its hooks.

266,Deemo,/wiki/Deemo,Rhythm,Rayark,Flyhigh Works,"September 20, 2017","September 28, 2017","September 28, 2017"," The core gameplay of Deemo is a score-based music video game. Each playable song features three main levels, namely Easy, Normal, Hard, each given a difficulty rating measured in a 'Level' scale. The levels were originally being ranged between 1 and 10, however the introduction of the Level 11 song Myosotis in the 2.0 version and the Level 12 song Marigold in the 3.0 version, marks the extension of the levels range, now being ranged from 1 to 12. A few selected songs also have an unlockable ""Extra"" difficulty which may have letters in place of the level number. There is also a ""Novice"" difficulty, easier than ""Easy"", but such scores will not be recorded. The player can also customize the speed of the notes before starting a level, in a scale of 0.5 (slowest) to 9.5 (fastest). Songs can also be ""autoplayed"", which plays the song automatically but disqualifies any scores. Some assist options, such as ""always-correct"" sound even when the player misses notes, may also disqualify scores.  In each level, a black line is affixed at the bottom of the screen, and horizontal bars known as ""notes"" approach the line at a perspective from background to foreground. The player must tap on the notes when they reach the bottom line in time with the music, resembling playing on a piano. Black notes require the player to tap each individually, while yellow notes allow the player to slide across in a chain. Black notes with a white interior are the same as normal black notes, only representing non-piano sounds, but otherwise the same gameplay-wise. Mine notes are the opposite: the player should not tap or slide the note when they reach the bottom line.  The player's performance is judged by the accuracy at which each note is hit, where a ""Charming"" hit is more accurate than a normal hit. ""Charming"" hits are subdivided into two types, ""True Charming"" and ""Regular Charming"", where ""True Charming"" means hitting exactly at the bottom line. Misses are also subdivided into three types, blue, purple, and no glow. At the end of each level, the game shows the player's overall performance in a result screen, providing the proportion of ""Charming"" hits, the longest chain of consecutive successful hits (Combo), and the overall accuracy in percentage form, with 100% denoting all hits are ""Charming"". The result screen will congratulate the player for hitting all notes successfully (Full Combo) or achieving 100% accuracy (All Charming).  Hitting all notes with a ""True Charming"" is called 理論値.  The player's performance is also judged by the ""Deemo meter"", which starts at half full in the beginning of the song. All types of hits (True Charming, Regular Charming, Normal) increase the Deemo meter, blue-glow Misses neither increase nor decrease the Deemo meter, while purple- and no-glow Misses decrease the Deemo meter. The song is failed when the Deemo meter is empty at any time during the song, however, if there is any Deemo meter remaining at the end of the song, the song is cleared. The Deemo meter difficulty can also be selected, but selecting any difficulty lower than ""Normal"" will disqualify scores unless a ""Full Combo"" or ""All Charming"" is obtained. One achievement in Deemo Reborn, called ""I Miss You"", requires a player to clear a song with all Misses. This means, a player should obtain as many blue-glow Misses as possible while not obtaining any type of hits.  The player's performance is also judged by the ""EX accuracy"", which is ""harder"" than the normal accuracy, but  combos do not affect it. True Charming hits receive full EX accuracy, Regular Charming hits only receive 2/3 of full EX accuracy (as opposed to full accuracy), and Normal hits only receive 1/3 of full EX accuracy. Misses of any type receive zero EX accuracy (as well as zero normal accuracy). Getting 100% EX accuracy is synonymous with 理論値.  If there are 250 ""Charming"" hits in a row during a song, a charm (no effect on gameplay) will be visible.   The game's plot centers around a little girl named Alice that falls from an open trapdoor in the sky, and a black, mysterious character Deemo who, to help the girl return to her own world, plays piano music to grow a special tree sapling sprouting from the piano. As the tree grows, various rooms of the structure open for the girl to explore. The girl also encounters a person wearing a white gown and mask, referred to as the ""Masked Lady"", who expresses annoyance towards Deemo and the girl trying to grow the tree.  When the tree stops growing at a 20-meter height, the girl discovers a stairway through a painting in the side room and walks into it with Deemo. The stairway leads to a chamber with another piano covered in thick thorns. As Deemo plays on that piano, large-scale tremors occur and the tree resumes growth.  The tree stops growing again at the final 50-meter height, which unlocks a final room from thorns. As the girl and Deemo enter the room, the Masked Lady grabs hold of the girl and the two struggle. Deemo stops the Masked Lady with pats on her head, and proceeds into the room with the girl, leaving the Masked Lady behind.  The final room contains a piano and a hovering platform. Deemo plays more piano music which builds a stairway to reach the platform. When the stairway is fully built, Deemo walks the girl up the staircases and raises her onto the platform, then returns to the piano to play one final tune. The playable song ends with the message ""Goodbye, my beloved sister, Alice."", suggesting the girl's name.  As the song finishes, Deemo is revealed to be a manifestation of Alice's elder brother Hans and gradually disintegrates. A series of flashback scenes reveals the siblings were involved in a fatal traffic accident, where Hans sacrificed himself to save Alice. Alice bursts into tears as the platform elevates towards the trapdoor and the Masked Lady removes her hood and mask, revealing her as another Alice (Revealed to be called Celia in The Last Recital) who wanted to prevent her from leaving so that they could be with Hans. As Deemo's world crumbles and he disappears, Alice wakes up in a hospital bed, attached with medical instruments. She removes them and rushes to the window only to find that she escaped Deemo's world, that she was in a coma the whole time and her brother is dead, after the two were hit by a truck and Hans was fatally injured. Alice then collapses into tears as nurses rush to her side to try and comfort her. After the credits, it is revealed that she takes up piano in his memory.  "
269,Defense Grid 2,/wiki/Defense_Grid_2,Tower defense,Hidden Path Entertainment,Hidden Path Entertainment,Unreleased,"February 7, 2019","February 7, 2019"," The player takes on the role of the commander, tasked with defending bases, colonies, space stations, and outposts from waves of aliens attempting to grab and escape with the power cores housed in each location. The player views the game from a top-down perspective and has the ability to build various towers that attack and route the path for the waves of aliens. Once an alien reaches the power core housing, it will make its way back towards the exit. If the alien is killed on its way back, the core will drop and slowly float back to the core housing. Different towers provide various abilities that are good against different types of aliens so the player must build a strategy to defend the cores against all waves of aliens.  Killing aliens garners resources along with slow generation and interest over time. Resources are used to build and upgrade towers which can be sold again at a loss. Tower upgrades increase various statistics including fire power and range. Most towers are similar to those in the original game. However, a new tower type to Defense Grid 2 is the boost tower. It does no damage on its own but it blocks the path of aliens like regular towers and can be used as an inexpensive means of controlling the path of aliens. Additionally, towers built on top of a boost tower provide the upper tower extra upgrades and a better line-of-sight.  The aliens in Defense Grid 2 come in a variety of types. Some are weak but they run very quickly. Others are slow yet heavily armored. Other types have force field shields. Different towers are effective against each of these kinds of aliens. Waves are queued at the top of the user interface with icons representing what types of aliens will be in the wave, allowing the player to plan his or her tower placement and strategy ahead of time.  At the beginning of each level, the player can choose a special ability or none at all. Among the options is the orbital laser which makes its return from the original game. The orbital laser allows the player to manually fire a large burst of energy at a group of aliens after it has charged, a process taking several minutes.  "

Players are barely able to move by themselves and are therefore required to use the environment for propulsion by utilizing the ""Gravitize"" ability to increase their gravitational pull. By turning this ability on when going downhill, the player will go faster; turning it off when going uphill will result in less of a decrease in speed.  There are speed boosts throughout the levels, either in the shape of little orbs which give the player a short burst of speed or as bottles or pools of ""Enerjuice"" which fill up a blue meter and can be used whenever the player chooses.  The player also has the ability to ""Magnetize"" which allows the player to stick to surfaces when going upside down or vertically.  "

The player directly controls a human named Kris, but they may also select actions for other characters in the game. Similarly to Undertale, Deltarune includes puzzles and bullet hell sections in which the player must move a heart around a boxed area while avoiding attacks. Undertale's random encounter system has been removed; players can now see the enemies directly on the field, allowing for the possibility of avoiding them.  Combat is turn-based. Players can choose from a set of actions each turn such as fight, act, spare, using an item, or defend, which reduces incoming damage. Brushing against attacks without touching them increases the Tension Points (TP) gauge, which allow party members to use spells. For example, Ralsei can pacify enemies by singing them to sleep. When a party member's hit points (HP) reaches 0, they become downed and can't fight anymore. The HP of downed party members will regenerate automatically until it reaches 1; healing items or Ralsei's healing spell will also revive them.  While the goal of the game is implicitly to avoid fights and spare monsters, this is made difficult in that Susie—who is not initially controlled by the player—would attack enemies rather than spare them, and thus the player must also warn enemies of Susie's attacks if they want to show mercy.

At times, the player encounters people in the game who can be talked with for clues and trivia. The game's main interface features a simple system connected to the mouse, in which the player left-clicks an object/person to use it/talk to, and right-click it to examine it, while a hint system, indicating interactive elements, can be activated by holding down the mouse's middle button.  The game's unique elements are special puzzles that the player can skip if they cannot solve them, a tutorial phase at the beginning, as well as a unique, humorous option available after completing the game, which when activated causes descriptions/names of objects and people, and all spoken dialog, to be changed to being only ""Droggeljug"".

He later awakens to find the campus deserted due to an incoming typhoon. While leaving, he encounters a senior, Fang Ray-shin (方芮欣), sleeping in the auditorium. With the river bridge exit inaccessible, they decide to wait out the storm in Wei's classroom. Wei decides to look for a phone, and the game shifts to Ray waking up in the auditorium again, this time in a nightmarish version of the school with Wei's corpse hanging upside down from the stage ceiling. After performing a ritual where she must cut Wei's throat and collect his blood, Ray wanders the rest of the school, avoiding different kinds of ghosts, solving puzzles, finding clues, and Ray's story is slowly pieced together:  Ray was a bright student at Greenwood High School but developed depression due to problems at home. The school notices her falling grades and sends her to speak with the school counselor, Chang Ming-hui (張明暉). She and Chang develop a romantic relationship, though she is unaware that Chang helps Miss Yin smuggle banned books for a secret book club where Wei is also a member. After they finish counseling sessions, Chang ends their relationship, leaving Ray heartbroken. She overhears Chang and Miss Yin arguing how his relationship with Ray can endanger their book club, and she misinterprets this as Miss Yin trying to take Chang from her.   It is revealed that Ray heard this in the auditorium on the night of the storm. While waiting in Wei's classroom, she convinced Wei to give her a copy of the reading list. Inspired by the way her mother got rid of her father by reporting him to authorities, Ray hands the list to Instructor Bai, a military officer, hoping it would get Miss Yin fired. However, this led to the arrest of the students who were members of the club. Miss Yin fled the country before they could capture her, but Chang was executed. Ray was awarded for her actions but was ostracized by her classmates who labeled her a snitch. Distraught by the bullying, the guilt of sending her classmates to prison, and Chang's death, Ray committed suicide by jumping off a school building. The player is actually playing as Ray's soul going through a cycle of purgatory as she refuses to accept her guilt.   Towards the end, Ray's shadow appears and asks her a series of questions. If Ray refuses to acknowledge her actions and guilt, the shadow states that she and Ray are not the same, and Ray walks down a path beside a river of blood, with Wei, Chang, and Miss Yin telling her the cycle will not end. She enters the auditorium where people applaud her as her shadow awards her with a noose. Ray hangs herself, and the auditorium fades into its abandoned state in the present, and Ray's soul will repeat the cycle. If she shows guilt and remorse, she finds a paper airplane containing a message of love and farewell from Chang and heads to his office. She witnesses Chang's arrest, and he tells Ray that people should be born to live freely without fear of oppression.  The game shifts to the present. Wei, an old man (revealed to be the random man Ray would see wandering the school earlier in the game) was pardoned following the end of the White Terror. His journal reveals he had spent several years in prison doing hard labor. Miss Yin spent the rest of her life abroad, speaking out against the country's oppression but died of lung cancer before she could return home. He heads to his old classroom and sits at his desk as Ray's ghost sits across him as they did on the night of the storm.  "
276,Devil May Cry,/wiki/Devil_May_Cry_(video_game),Action-adventure,Capcom,Capcom,"June 27, 2019","June 24, 2019","June 25, 2019"," The gameplay consists of levels called ""missions"", where players must fight numerous enemies, perform platforming tasks, and occasionally solve puzzles to progress through the story. The player's performance in each mission is given a letter grade D increasing to C, B, and A with an additional top grade of S. Grades are based on the time taken to complete the mission, the amount of ""red orbs"" gathered (the in-game currency obtained from defeated enemies), how ""stylish"" their combat was, item usage, and damage taken.  ""Stylish"" combat is defined as performing an unbroken series of varied attacks while avoiding damage, with player performance tracked by an on-screen gauge. The more hits the player makes, the higher the gauge rises. The gauge starts at ""Dull""; progresses through ""Cool"", ""Bravo"", and ""Absolute""; and peaks at ""Stylish"". Repeatedly using the same moves causes the gauge to stop rising, forcing the player to use every move in their arsenal. The gauge terms are similar to the grades given at the end of the missions. When Dante receives damage, the style rating resets back to ""Dull"". Players can also maintain their style grade by taunting enemies at close range.  The player can temporarily transform Dante into a more powerful demonic creature by using the ""Devil Trigger"" ability. Doing so adds powers based on the current weapon and changes Dante's appearance. The transformations typically increase strength and defense, slowly restore health, and grant special attacks. It is governed by the Devil Trigger gauge, which depletes as the ability is used, and is refilled by attacking enemies or taunting in normal form.  Devil May Cry contains puzzles and other challenges besides regular combat gameplay. The main storyline often requires the player to find key items to advance, in a manner similar to puzzles in the Resident Evil games, as well as optional platforming and exploration tasks to find hidden caches of ""orbs"". Side quests, called ""Secret Missions"" in the game, are located in hidden or out-of-the-way areas and are not required for completion, but provide permanent power-ups. They typically challenge the player to defeat a group of enemies in a specific manner or within a time limit.   Devil May Cry begins with Dante being attacked in his office by a mysterious woman named Trish. He impresses her by easily brushing off her assault, and tells her that he hunts demons in pursuit of those who killed his mother and brother. She says the attack was a test, and that the demon emperor Mundus, whom Dante holds responsible for the deaths of his family, is planning a return. The scene jumps to their arrival at an immense castle on Mallet Island, whereupon Trish abruptly leaps and vanishes over a high wall.  Dante explores the castle and encounters the game's stock enemies, demonic marionettes. He also finds a new sword called Alastor, and battles the first boss, a giant spider/scorpion demon named Phantom. Dante wins the battle, but in what becomes a recurring theme, the defeated boss monster reappears a short time later in a corridor, forcing Dante to choose a narrow escape or to fight in the tight confines. After further exploration and combat, Dante battles a demon named Nelo Angelo who impresses Dante with his confidence. Dante manages to defeat Nelo Angelo and is about to deliver the final blow - but unfortunately, Nelo Angelo evades him, and counterattacks Dante furiously with a series of punches and kicks. The demon prepares to kill Dante but suddenly flees upon seeing the half-amulet Dante wears, which contains a picture of his mother. The demon attacks twice more in later missions, and is eventually revealed to be Dante's identical twin brother, Vergil. After Angelo/Vergil's death, his amulet joins with his brother's half, and ""Force Edge"", the game's default sword, which had belonged to the twins' father, changes into its true form and becomes the Sparda sword.  When Dante next meets Trish, she betrays him and reveals that she too is working for Mundus, but when her life is endangered, Dante chooses to save her. Claiming he did so only because of her resemblance to his mother, he warns her to stay away. Yet when he finally confronts Mundus, who is about to kill Trish, Dante again chooses to save her and is injured. Mundus tries to finish him off, but Trish takes the attack instead. This unleashes Dante's full power, thus allowing him to take on the form of Sparda. Dante and Mundus then battle on another plane of existence.  Dante is victorious, and leaves the amulet and sword with Trish's immobile body before departing. Returning to the Human World, Dante finds that the island is collapsing, and is cornered by the injured Mundus, who has followed him back to the Human World. Dante fights Mundus, now back to his regular strength, when Trish also returns and lends Dante her power. Dante defeats Mundus, who vows to return and rule the human world. When Trish tries to apologize she begins to cry, and Dante tells her it means she has become human and not just a devil, because ""devils never cry"". Dante and Trish escape on a plane as the island collapses. After the credits, it is revealed that Dante and Trish are working together as partners, and have renamed the shop ""Devil Never Cry"".  "

The game consists of missions with specific goals in the play area of the game itself. The player's performance in each mission is ranked from D (poor/""Don't Worry"") to S (excellent/""Showtime"") based on the time taken to complete the mission, the amount of Red Orbs collected, the overall ""style"" displayed during fights, item usage, and damage taken. In contrast to the rest of the gameplay, the style judging system used in the game has been cited as being the harshest in terms of how it judges the player's performance.  Combat itself is based on the ""style"" the player demonstrates during a fight. The rating the player gains for style is improved by hitting enemies continuously while avoiding damage. This ranges from ""Don't Worry"", progressing to ""Come On!"", ""Bingo"", ""Are You Ready?"" and peaking at ""Showtime"". If the character takes damage, the style rating falls back to ""Don't Worry"".  The game's controls convert short sequences of button presses into complex on-screen actions. New to the series is an evasion button, which allows Dante or Lucia to roll, dodge enemy attacks, or run along walls. Another new feature is a weapon-change button, which allows the player to cycle through ranged weapons without switching to the inventory screen.  The game also features puzzle-solving and exploration elements. involves the player examining their surroundings to find items and orbs. Red Orbs are used to acquire new combat powers and abilities for the characters. These Red Orbs are ""the blood of demons""; enemies drop them when they are defeated. Dante and Lucia can also purchase items, which allow them to restore their damaged health or even instantly revive should they be killed by an enemy's attack.  The Devil Trigger ability enables Dante and Lucia to transform into a demon form. This changes their appearance, increases their strength and defense, slowly restores health, and enables them to use special attacks and other passive and movement abilities, including increased speed and the power to fly. The Devil Trigger state lasts as long as there is power in the Devil Trigger Gauge, which increases by attacking or taunting enemies in the normal state and decreases by attacking in the Devil Trigger state or using Devil Trigger-only attacks. Unique to this game is the Desperation Devil Trigger — an enhanced form of the Devil Trigger — available to Dante when he is low on health.  Players can also use Trish after beating the Hard Mode with Dante. Trish's gameplay is heavily different than Dante, while retaining some of his moves, but she has her own gimmick of her sword combat. Trish can also switch between Sword of Sparda and a hand-to-hand combat. Unlike Dante and Lucia, Trish uses a power-up aura for her ""Devil Trigger"".   Devil May Cry 2 begins with Lucia and Dante separately entering a museum where an important item called the Medaglia is stored. After defeating a group of demons in the museum, Lucia invites Dante to follow her to the Dumary Island, where he is introduced to Matier, her mother. Matier explains that she once fought alongside Dante's father, Sparda, to defend the island against demons. She asks Dante to help fight Arius, an international businessman who is using demonic power in an effort to conquer the world. Dante flips a coin in answer, and decides to help when the coin lands on heads. After Dante leaves, Matier and Lucia discuss the Arcana, the items required for Arius to raise the demon Argosax.  Lucia eventually confronts Arius, who reveals that she was his creation. When she moves to strike him, he uses his magic to blast her away. Shortly afterward, Dante meets up with Lucia, who gives him the last of the Arcana before leaving. Dante then encounters Matier and tries to pass the Arcana to her. Matier, in turn, asks Dante to take the Arcana to save Lucia, who has gone to fight Arius again. Dante flips the coin again to decide if he will help; it lands on heads, and he departs to aid Lucia. Meanwhile, Lucia enters the Uroboros tower and attacks Arius, who captures her. Dante arrives and trades the Arcana for Lucia, then attacks Arius. To escape, Arius forces Dante to decide between saving Lucia or killing him.  Lucia, worried about the ritual and conflicted about herself, wonders how they will stop Arius. Dante waves her off, stating he will find a way. Dante leaves Lucia to think as he departs to defeat Arius. Matier arrives a short time later, sets Lucia's mind at ease, and persuades her to rejoin the fight against Arius. Dante arrives at the tower to find Arius in the middle of his immortality-inducing ritual. However, Dante is not worried as he switched one of the Arcana with a false coin. Another fight ensues, in which Dante finishes Arius off with his pistols. Outside, Lucia confronts Dante and demands that he kill her because she fears she will become a demon herself. Before the issue can be resolved, a large stream of energy strikes the tower and a portal to the demon world is opened. Dante and Lucia argue over who will enter and close it from the inside; Dante offers to leave the issue up to fate. He flips the coin and it once again lands on heads, leaving Dante to enter the portal to deal with the partially summoned Argosax, after leaving the coin with Lucia.  After Dante departs, Arius returns to life bearing demonic power. While Lucia fights Arius, he finds himself injured and attempts to distract her, a tactic which fails, and Lucia goes on to defeat him. Within the portal, Dante fights and defeats Argosax. Finding the portal closed behind him, Dante instead drives further into the demon realm on a motorcycle. In the aftermath of the battle, Matier attempts to reassure Lucia about Dante's fate, insisting that Sparda returned from a similar trip. Lucia examines the coin Dante left with her and discovers that both sides are identical. Sometime later, in Dante's shop, Lucia muses about Dante. Outside the sound of a motorcycle echoes, and Lucia leaves to investigate. The player is not shown if Dante has returned.  "

The player's performance in each mission is graded from D through C, B and A, with top marks of S and SS. Grades are based on time taken to complete a mission, the number of red orbs (currency obtained from defeated enemies) gathered, ""stylish"" combat, item usage and damage received. The games tracks stylish combat by an on-screen gauge, which is the performance of a series of attacks (""combos"") while avoiding damage. The longer a player attacks without repetition and evades damage, the higher the score. The gauge registers ""Dope"" after a few attacks, progressing through ""Crazy"", ""Blast"", ""Alright"", ""Sweet"", ""SShowtime"" to peak at ""SSStylish"". If Dante receives damage, the style rating falls; if the gauge is ""Crazy"" or below, it will reset. Devil May Cry 3's battle system allows a player to link attacks, with each weapon having a set number of attacks.  Devil Trigger is a mechanic which enables the player's character to assume a demonic form. This alters the character's appearance, increases attack and defense, restores health and enables special attacks. This is a departure from the previous titles, where Dante draws power from weapons and items he procures throughout the game. The Devil Trigger state lasts as long as there is energy in the Devil Trigger gauge; the gauge rises by attacking or taunting enemies in normal mode, and falls when using the Devil Trigger transformation or other abilities using Devil Trigger power. The Devil Trigger mode is not available to Dante until one-third of the way through the game, while Vergil, playable in the special edition, has the ability at the outset.  The other major difference from previous Devil May Cry games is Devil May Cry 3's combat system, which allows a player to choose one of Dante's four combat styles; each style has a different focus and techniques. Dante can switch between all four equipped weapons (two guns, two melees) on the fly, allowing for far greater combat freedom and variety than in previous Devil May Cry games. Style selection is available at checkpoints and at the beginning of each level. The styles are ""Trickster"", for dodging and agility; ""Swordmaster"", with abilities for swords and other weapons; ""Gunslinger"", with firearms techniques; and ""Royal Guard"", which allows a player to repel attacks with a button press (storing energy for retaliation). Later in the game, two additional styles become unlocked: ""Quicksilver"", slowing enemies, while the character attacks at normal speed; and ""Doppelgänger"", which creates a shadow double who fights alongside Dante. A second player may control the shadow double by pressing ""Start"" on a second controller. A two-player mode, similar to the Doppelgänger style, is accessible while Dante and Vergil battle Arkham. In the special edition Vergil has another style, ""Dark Slayer"", which is similar to Trickster.  The Nintendo Switch version of Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition added the ability to switch between styles at any point during combat.   Devil May Cry 3 starts with Dante's yet-unnamed shop in an American metropolis. A mysterious man, Arkham, arrives with an invitation from Dante's brother Vergil in the guise of a demonic attack. After Dante defeats a group of demons, a huge tower erupts from the ground nearby, eclipsing the sprawling city surrounding it. Sensing that Vergil is on top of the structure, Dante interprets this as a challenge. He begins fighting more demons during his journey, some of which become his weapons once defeated. Dante is attacked by a woman on a motorcycle who turns out to be Mary, Arkham's daughter, who wants revenge on her father for causing her mother's death. It is revealed that Arkham works for Vergil; they plan to take Dante's half of their mother's amulet and use its power on the tower to connect the human and demonic worlds.  After a number of battles and an encounter with a being named Jester, Dante reaches the tower's summit and battles Vergil. Vergil defeats Dante by stabbing him with his own sword, Rebellion, steals his amulet and leaves. Dante's blood releases a seal on Rebellion, causing Dante's dormant demonic powers emerge, and he sets out in pursuit. He catches Vergil in a control room in the tower's basement, where Vergil cannot reactivate the tower. The brothers fight again, until they are interrupted by Mary and Jester. Jester reveals himself to be Arkham, who has manipulated them all to reactivate the tower in order to reach the demonic world. There he plans to steal the Force Edge, the dormant form of Sparda's sword with his power, using it to rule a demon-infested Earth. The tower transforms as the spell is broken; Arkham is carried to the summit, and Vergil disappears in the confusion.  Dante battles his way back up the tower, fighting Mary for the right to pursue Arkham. He is victorious, and Mary lends him her most powerful weapon. Reaching the summit, Dante crosses to the demonic world and catches Arkham, who has by now assumed Sparda's demonic form. Overwhelmed by power, Arkham transforms into a blob-like creature and attacks Dante. During their fight, Vergil reappears, and the brothers work together to expel Arkham from the demonic world. Weakened, Arkham lands on the tower where Mary finds him. She renounces her name and calls herself Lady, a nickname given to her by Dante because she refused to tell him her name, before killing him. In the demonic world, Dante and Vergil fight for ownership of the Force Edge and the amulet halves. After Vergil's defeat, he remains as the portal closes, vanishing with his half of the amulet.  Dante meets Mary outside the tower. They become friends and begin a partnership as demon-slayers; Dante ends up naming his shop ""Devil May Cry"". A scene after the credits shows Vergil in the demonic world, weak but determined, as he charges into battle against his father's old foe Mundus.  "
279,Dex,/wiki/Dex_(video_game),Action role-playing,Dreadlocks Ltd,QubicGames,Unreleased,"July 24, 2020","July 24, 2020"," Dex is a 2D side-scrolling platform game focused on exploration and non-linear gameplay, more like a Role-playing game.

282,Dicey Dungeons,/wiki/Dicey_Dungeons,Roguelike,Terry Cavanagh,Terry Cavanagh,2020,2020,2020," Dicey Dungeons combines elements of roguelike games with deck-building games. The game takes place on a game show-like backdrop, where Lady Luck challenges adventurers, each having been turned into a dice, to complete a dungeon with a rather unlikely chance of winning their freedom.  The player takes one of six characters, which defines the type of equipment they will start with. The player then moves their character across a dungeon map, where there are various encounters with monsters, treasure chests, health items, shops, and upgrade stations, along with exits to the next level. The goal of each run is to reach the lowest level of the dungeon and defeat the boss. Doing so unlocks the metagame progression, such as unlocking additional characters, or new episodes for existing characters that introduce new rulesets that make runs more difficult.  When encountering a monster, the combat takes place in a turn-based manner. On their turn, the player is shown their equipment, each which has slots for one or more dice to be added, and then a random roll of the number of dice their character currently possesses. The player then places each dice into one of the equipment slots; when all slots are filled, this creates a combat effect. For example, a sword may have a slot for a single dice, and when a dice is slotted, it will do the damage shown on that dice. Some slots have specific requirements, such as an odd or even number, or dice values less or greater than some number. Some equipment or abilities can alter the dice rolls, allowing the dice to be reused. The player continues to slot dice into equipment and abilities until they have exhausted their dice for the turn, or end their turn early. Their opponents have similar equipment with dice slots, and arranges their attacks in similar manner. There are various buffs and debuffs that can be triggered through equipment from both the player and enemy. Combat continues until the player character's health or the enemies' health drops to zero, or both. If only the player-character's health is reduced to zero, then the game is over and the player must restart the game. If the enemy's health is reduced to zero, the enemy is defeated and the player-character wins, gaining in-game monetary rewards and character experience, along with other potential rewards. By gaining levels, the player-character gains more total health as well as an extra dice that is rolled. The player may also get new equipment that they can equip on the character at any time outside of battles. Shops in levels can be used to buy new equipment, trade equipment, or other features. Upgrade stations can improve the effect of one piece of equipment.  "
285,Digimon Survive,/wiki/Digimon_Survive,Role-playing,Witchcraft,Bandai Namco Entertainment,2020,2020,2020," Player choices influence the direction of the story, including the Digimon's digivolution process. Multiple playthroughs can result in different paths and different digivolutions. The game will feature multiple endings and should wrong choices be made, characters will be killed. The game is split into multiple types of gameplay, such as ""Drama Parts"", ""Search Action"", ""Free Action"", and ""Free Battle"". During ""Drama Parts"" the game proceeds as a text adventure to tell the story. In ""Search Actions"", the player searches for a way to survive. In ""Free Action"", the player chooses where to go and whom to talk due in a limited window of time. During ""Free Battle"", the player can enter certain areas to train their Digimon and collect items.   Takuma Momozuka, Minoru Hyuuga, Aoi Shibuya, Saki Kimijima, Ryou Tominaga, Shuuji Kayama, Kaito Shinonome, Miu Shinonome, and others are on a historical studies extracurricular activities camp during spring break. On the second day Takuma, Minoru and Aoi visit a famous local temple to investigate the legend of the ""Beast Gods"" (Kemonogami) where a festival to celebrate them will take place. As they explore, they come across Koromon, then hear screaming. Koromon and the group run to the source and find their classmates being attacked by other Digimon. Koromon digivolves to Agumon and scares the Digimon away. It is at this point, that Takuma and the others discover they are in another world.  "

However, while Windjammers is played from an overhead top-down perspective from the sidelines, Disc Jam is played from a behind the character, third-person perspective.

288,Disco Elysium,/wiki/Disco_Elysium,Role-playing,ZA/UM,ZA/UM,Unreleased,2020,2020," Disco Elysium is a role-playing video game that features an open world and dialogue-heavy gameplay mechanics. The game is presented in an isometric perspective in which the player character is controlled. The player takes the role of a detective on a murder case who suffers from alcohol and drug-induced amnesia. The player can move the detective about the current screen to interact with non-player characters (NPC) and highlighted objects or move onto other screens. Early in the game they gain a partner, Kim Kitsuragi, another detective who acts as the protagonist's voice of professionalism and who may be able to offer advice or support in certain dialog options. Other NPCs may be influenced to become temporary companions that join the group and provide similar support.  The gameplay features no combat in the traditional sense; instead, it is handled through skill checks and dialogue trees. There are four primary abilities in the game: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, and Motorics, and each ability has six distinct secondary skills for a total of 24. The player improves these skills through skill points earned from leveling up. The choice of clothing that the player equips on the player-character can impart both positive and negative effects on certain skills. Upgrading these skills help the player character pass skill checks, made based on a random dice roll, but could also potentially result in negative effects and character quirks. For instance, a player character with high Drama may be able to detect and fabricate lies effectively, but may also become prone to hysterics and paranoia. Likewise, high Electrochemistry shields the player character from the negative effects of drugs and provides knowledge on them, but may also lead to substance abuse and other self-destructive behaviors.  Disco Elysium features a secondary inventory system, the Thought Cabinet. Thoughts are unlockable through conversations with other characters, as well as through internal dialogues within the mind of the player character himself. The player is then able to ""internalize"" a thought through a certain amount of in-game hours, which, once completed, grants the player character permanent benefits but also occasionally negative effects, a concept that ZA/UM compared to the trait system used in the Fallout series. A limited number of slots are available in the Thought Cabinet at the start, though more can be gained with experience levels. For example, an early possible option for the Thought Cabinet is the ""Hobocop"" thought, which the character ponders the option of living on the streets to save money, which reduces the character's composure with other NPCs while the thought is internalized. When the character has completed the Hobocop thought, it then allows them to find more junk on the streets that can be sold for money.  The 24 skills also play into the dialogue trees, creating a situation where the player-character may have an internal debate with one aspect of their mind or body, creating the idea that the player is communicating with a fragmented persona. These internal conversations may provide suggestions or additional insight that can guide the player into actions or dialogue with the game's non-playable characters, depending on the skill points invested into the skill. For example, the Inland Empire, a subskill of the Psyche, is described by ZA/UM as a representation of the intensity of the soul, and may come into situations where the player-character may need to pass themselves off under a fake identity with the conviction behind that stance, should the player accept this suggestion when debating with Inland Empire.

289,Disgaea 1 Complete,/wiki/Disgaea_1_Complete,Tactical role-playing,Nippon Ichi Software,Nippon Ichi Software,"July 26, 2018","October 9, 2018","October 12, 2018"," Disgaea is a tactical role playing game. Battle gameplay takes place on a map divided into a square grid. The player controls a squad of humanoid units and monsters, which each occupy a single square of the grid and do combat with a group of enemies. Depending on the character and attack selected, the player will be able to deal damage to a specific enemy unit or a designated region of the map. Combat ends when all enemy units or all of the player's units are destroyed.  Humanoid characters may lift and throw other units across the map in order to allow allies to move further or force enemies to keep their distance. This even allows the player to capture enemies by throwing them into the base panel; these enemies then become allies, and can be used on subsequent maps.  The chance of capturing an enemy in this manner depends on several factors. Failure to capture the enemy will result in the death of all characters inside the base panel, and the enemy will survive.   The story of Disgaea opens with Laharl rising out of an open coffin in his room. Etna, one of the castle vassals, is standing next to him, surrounded by various weapons. She explains that he has been sleeping for two years, far longer than he intended, and his father, King Krichevskoy, has died. Laharl vows to reclaim the throne, and, after consulting with Etna and his other vassals, goes to Vyers' castle.  After defeating the demon Vyers, who refers to himself as the ""Dark Adonis"" and is renamed ""Mid-Boss"" by Laharl, he meets Angel Trainee Flonne. Flonne had been sent to the Netherworld by Seraph Lamington, the ruler of Celestia, to assassinate King Krichevskoy (who was already dead). Shocked by Laharl's lack of grief at his father's death, the eternally optimistic Flonne joins Laharl's party to determine if demons are capable of feeling love. Observing them in secret is the paranoid Archangel Vulcanus, who interprets Flonne's actions as treason and is convinced that she is plotting against him.  After Etna demands that Laharl pay the salary of the Prinnies that she has hired, he decides to attack the demon with the most money in the vicinity. This is Hoggmeiser at Dinero Palace.  After defeating Hoggmeiser, Laharl is about to kill him, until Hoggmeiser's son rushes out and gets in the way. Flonne convinces Laharl to spare them, and Laharl lets them keep some of the money. In response to this act, Hoggmeiser joins the party.  At one point, Flonne and Etna discover a photograph of Laharl in an embarrassing situation. Laharl refers to this as a ""paparazzi shot"", however, the actual contents of the photo are never actually revealed. A threat on the back of the photograph states that copies of it would be distributed if Laharl did not accept a challenge to fight for the overlordship; thus Laharl was blackmailed.  Responding to this challenge, Laharl meets Maderas, a vampire. He was banished by King Krichevskoy, for stealing the King's favorite snack, black pretzels. Maderas takes advantage of Laharl's two biggest weaknesses – optimism and women with sexy bodies. Maderas was also controlling Etna by holding her memory. He had instructed her to kill the prince, but she had put him to sleep for two years by poisoning him instead. Etna eventually betrays Maderas, and along with Laharl, Flonne, and Mid-Boss, defeats him.  Waking up later at night, Flonne discovers that several Prinnies are chanting and leaving the castle. Laharl, worried that his reputation will be tarnished if it is discovered that he let his vassals escape, chases after them the next morning. Eventually, he runs into Death, and the player learns that Big Sis Prinny is actually Laharl's mother; she became a Prinny because she gave her life to save him.  After Laharl becomes the undisputed Overlord of the Netherworld, he meets a group of humans from Earth: Gordon, Defender of Earth; Jennifer, his assistant; and the robot Thursday. Gordon has been led to believe that his mission is to assassinate Laharl due to an impending attack on Earth by the Netherworld. Laharl promises not to invade Earth if Gordon defeats him, on the condition that Gordon becomes one of his vassals if he wins; Gordon is embarrassed by his ensuing loss and servitude. After the Earth Defense Force appears in the Netherworld, it is revealed that Gordon was actually sent to secure a path for an invasion of the Netherworld by the humans, who had been tricked by Vulcanus.  General Carter sends Kurtis to the Netherworld, and eventually goes there himself on the Space Battleship Gargantua. Kurtis abducts Jennifer, and Laharl engages the EDF fleet of spaceships in a rescue attempt, destroying all but the Gargantua by himself. When Laharl and his party arrive at the Gargantua's bridge, several angels from Celestia appear and attack them. After being defeated, General Carter escapes, only to have Mid-Boss appear to give him a message.  In response to this turn of events, Flonne and the rest of the party decide to go to Celestia to confront the Seraph. Vulcanus goes to Seraph Lamington, declares that Flonne is a traitor who is leading an army of demons in an invasion of Celestia, and goes to lead a group of angels to repel this ""invasion"". Vulcanus reveals to Laharl and his party that he intends to conquer all three worlds and rule over them as a god. After defeating Vulcanus, Laharl finally meets the Seraph and Flonne explains Vulcanus' plan and what she has learnt while travelling with Laharl. The Seraph accepts her version of events and agrees that demons are, in fact, capable of feeling love. However, he declares that Flonne must be punished because she fought against other angels, and turns her into a flower. Outraged at this injustice, Laharl attacks the Seraph, initiating the game's final battle.  The game has multiple endings. Depending on the way the game was played up to this point, the Seraph may or may not survive, Flonne either remains a flower, is restored to her original form, or is transformed into a Fallen Angel, and Laharl either becomes a great Overlord, disappears and leaves Etna in charge of the Netherworld, or dies and becomes a Prinny. It may also be noted that, on the Good Ending, when the spirit of Laharl's mother appears to him, Vyers appears to already know her, and the way he talks to Laharl suggests that he is King Krichevskoy.  There is one ""Joke"" ending, which can be obtained very early in the game, in Episode 1, if the final boss of the chapter defeats all of the characters in battle, a cutscene will play showing Vyers naming himself Overlord before the ending credits roll. After the ending credits, like with all endings, the game will ask you to save previous data and the player will then be sent to the main menu, where the player can reload the saved data and start a new game +, referred to in-game as a New Cycle.

Allies can be deployed into combat, each with their own special skills and ""Evilities"", additional abilities that are applied to every character. Enemies and allies may be picked up and thrown, just like previous Disgaea games. However, Disgaea 4 adds a new feature to its grabbing system, allowing any friendly character on the field to pick up another adjacent friendly character, and continuously pick up allies, in a tower fashion. When in the tower formation, the movement range of the stacked characters increase. The bottom character of the tower can also throw the tower ahead of him/her to further increase movement distance. Special abilities may be activated while in tower formation, such as specific team attacks and the ability to obtain items normally unreachable due to a wall.  Friendly monsters can be Magichanged by unique characters to become weapons. A new function has also been added called ""Demon Fuse"". With Demon Fuse, the player can join two monsters to form a giant version of the combined monsters, as well as increasing statistics. Demon Fused monsters can be Magichanged as well, and the result is a giant weapon, to correspond with the size of the Demon Fused monster.  Valvatorez owns a hub location known as ""Hades"". Here, equipment can be purchased or sold, specific functions can be carried out, the player can travel to other locations to advance the story, and such. Unlike previous Disgaea hub towns, Hades comes with the ability to be rearranged to the player's liking, as well as changing the appearance.  As the player progresses through the story, Valvatorez's amount of captured land will grow, and as such, more characters can be befriended. Various items can also be placed on the land panels, as well as characters. When an item is placed on a panel, it may affect the layout or gameplay when a battle is initiated on that panel. For instance, having a certain item on a panel allows captured enemies to be ""Disciplined"".  When an enemy is captured, when certain conditions are met, the player may ""Discipline"" the captured enemy. When an enemy is being disciplined, the player may force them to perform a variety of actions, such as ""Slap With A Wad Of Bills"". The player has a limited number of turns to perform actions on the target, and then the player may force the captive to give up their HL (money), force them to locate treasure for the player, recruit them as an ally, or simply let them go. If recruited as an ally, a disciplined enemy's job is renamed as ""Ex-hostage"".  Over the PlayStation Network, the player can build his or her own pirate ship, and place characters on it as they wish. By using this, the player can use their pirate ship to ""invade"" the custom worlds of other Disgaea 4 players, and challenge them. Other player's characters can be captured the same way as a normal enemy, and may be punished through the new ""Discipline"" system.  Players may also initiate pirate ship to pirate ship battles, see the total accumulated stats of all Disgaea 4 players, create battle maps to upload, use, and share, and send a specific council member, called a Foreign Minister, to another player's game to affect Senate in their game.

297,Don't Starve,/wiki/Don%27t_Starve,Action-adventure,Klei Entertainment,505 Games,Unreleased,"April 12, 2018","April 12, 2018"," Don't Starve is an action-adventure game with a randomly generated open world and elements of survival and roguelike gameplay. Combat is handled by  pointing and clicking with the mouse, while other activities are controlled by the keyboard, or using the inbuilt gamepad support to play using a controller, giving it a console-like gameplay feel. The goal is to survive as long as possible, and a count of the number of days the player has survived is shown onscreen. The game keeps few records of player progress besides the total number of experience points and the playable characters unlocked. Wilson is the default playable character, unlocked upon purchase of the game, but the next character, Willow, can be unlocked with 160 experience points. Woodie, the last character unlockable with experience, requires the game's limit of 1,600. The player earns 20 experience points each in-game day and receives them after dying. As is common among roguelikes, death is permanent, barring the use of several rare or expensive items like the Meat Effigy, TouchStone, and Life-Giving Amulet.  The game relies on a day/night cycle that causes meaningful fluctuations in gameplay style. During the day, the player spends most of their time exploring the world: gathering food, firewood, and other resources, discovering crafting recipes to combine available items, and avoiding enemies. With nightfall comes dangerous monsters and an invisible menace, Charlie, who attacks the player when the screen is dark. A player must have a light source or night vision to prevent Charlie from attacking. Crafting from recipes allows the player to build shelter, weapons, and tools like axes. Players can forage and farm plants as well as hunt animals for sustenance, with several characters having dietary perks or restrictions. Food can spoil, however, so the player cannot keep it for too long. Eating spoiled food results in a loss of health, sanity, and an increase in hunger. Each in-game day takes 8 minutes of real time.  Death can occur in a variety of ways. The player has three gauges displayed on the game's head-up display, which respectively track hunger, health, and sanity. Hunger worsens by default, being replenished with food. Sanity decreases during the dusk and night or as a result of specific unpleasant actions, such as robbing graves or fighting monsters; it can be replenished through mentally stimulating activities, such as sleeping, picking flowers, and wearing fashionable clothing. When hunger gets too low, it begins to chip away at health, which will eventually result in the player's death. A large variety of creatures can attack the player, including giant one-eyed birds, tree monsters, tentacles whose owners are not shown, and even small, weak frogs that will nonetheless try to accost the player and steal from them. Additionally, at low enough sanity, figments of the character's imagination become corporeal and able to attack the player. Some creatures, such as pig-like creatures often found in tribes, begin as neutral to the player (Excluding the Reign of Giants character Webber), but the player's actions may lead them to be allies or hostile foes.  The bulk of the game is played in Sandbox Mode, but there is a second mode, Adventure, which the player can access by finding a landmark called Maxwell's Door. Adventure serves as the game's campaign, consisting of five levels that pit the player against Maxwell, the antagonist of Don't Starve. The player loses all items and recipes upon entering, and can only pick four to keep upon completion of each chapter. Death or the end of the five sections returns the player intact to Sandbox Mode.   "

Controls are similar to the previous game, with the addition of being able to pluck items from the ground and pick up and throw stunned enemies, and various controllers can be used with customizable controls. Like the previous game, players primarily control Donkey Kong who is assisted by a companion, who either provide additional abilities to Donkey Kong, or can be controlled individually by a second player. Along with Diddy Kong, who returns with his barrel jet pack for crossing large gaps, two additional characters are added; Dixie Kong and Cranky Kong. Dixie has the ability to spin her ponytail into a propeller and slowly descend through the air, with an initial boost in height at the start, allowing her and Donkey Kong to fly up out-of-reach platforms or items. Cranky, in a similar mechanic to the DuckTales video game, can use his cane to bounce on dangerous surfaces such as spiky thorns and reach higher areas and defeat certain enemies the other Kongs cannot. Filling up a 'Kong-POW' meter allows Donkey Kong and his partner to perform a special move which defeats all on-screen enemies and converts them into items depending on the partner.  The Super Guide from the previous game is absent and is replaced by an expanded shop, run by Funky Kong, offering various support items such as temporary invincibility. Like the previous game, each level contains various Kong letters and puzzle pieces, some of which require specific partners to reach, which unlock various bonuses and hidden levels. The Time Attack mode also returns, now featuring online leaderboards, allowing players to view video replays of the top ranked players.  The Nintendo Switch version of the game features Funky Kong as a new playable character. In the optional easier Funky Mode, Funky Kong is playable with no possible companions, along with an option to switch between him and Donkey Kong. Unlike Donkey Kong in the game's normal mode, Funky Kong comes with five hit points instead of two, while he is also able to double-jump, hover in mid-air, stand on spikes and breathe underwater for an unlimited time. When DK is played, he can gain a companion and each Kong has three hit points.   The story begins at Donkey Kong's hut, where the Kongs are celebrating his birthday. Suddenly, one of the balloons flies off the Kong house and over the sea, where Snowmad ships are stationed. Far away from the island, a Pointy Tuck watches over them, locating the Kong house and relaying info to their leader, shrouded in a dark silhouette. Upon the leader nodding their approval, the Pointy Tucks bring him a horn which he blows, creating a large amount of wind, as well as an ice dragon.  Just as he is about to blow the candle out of the fire, Donkey Kong notices a mysterious snowflake that appears and puts out the candle on his birthday cake. He turns away with a frustrated look on his face as he hears an uproar, and he and the other Kongs exit the house. The ice dragon from earlier flies toward Donkey Kong Island, turning the sea under it to ice. The Kongs are then blown away from the island by the ice dragon's intense winds, landing on the Lost Mangroves island. Afterwards, a large ship stations itself where the Volcano from Donkey Kong Country Returns used to be, and the Snowmads seize Donkey Kong Island for their own, turning it into a frosty area with continuous snowfall. Donkey Kong and his friends Diddy, Dixie and Cranky land inside an aircraft where the player must use the Y and X buttons to ground pound, causing the plane to break in half.  After traversing across five islands with each posing its own threats, the Kongs finally arrive at Donkey Kong Island under control of the Snowmads. The Kongs make their way through the frozen fortress until they encounter the leader of the Snowmads, Lord Fredrik, who challenges the Kongs to a final battle deep in the depths of the volcano. After a long battle, Donkey Kong delivers the final punch to Lord Fredrik, which sends him flying out through the roof of the Snowmad's ship, destroying it in the process. The Kongs wander out of the remains of the ship and look out from the mountainside to see the end of Lord Fredrik's fall. Lord Fredrik crashes into the remainder of the Snowmad ships out in the seas of the island, defeating the entire Snowmad clan and freeing the island from their control. Donkey Kong then notices that the horn that was used to freeze their island fell out of Lord Fredrik's hands during his fall, which he catches and blows into, producing a breeze of flowers that carries the Kongs to the bottom of the island. The Kongs watch and rejoice as the breeze of the flowers flutter around the island, melting all of the ice and snow, turning Donkey Kong Island back to normal. In a post credits scene, Donkey Kong discovers a box and opens it, unveiling a mysterious relic that unlocks the world Secret Seclusion.  "
299,Donut County,/wiki/Donut_County,Indie,Ben Esposito,Annapurna Interactive,"December 18, 2018","December 18, 2018","December 18, 2018"," In Donut County, the players control a hole across several different levels, each of which is self contained but has several areas that open up as they progress. The goal of the game is to swallow every object to essentially clear out the level. As players move the hole to swallow objects, the hole increases in size. There are some puzzle aspects to this; to swallow objects floating on top of water, the player may need to maneuver the hole to drain part of the water, and then have that water consumed by a bird, repeating this until the water is drained. Later in the game, the player gains access to a catapult that fits in the top of the hole. This can be used to fling certain items swallowed by it to hit outcroppings to dislodge objects or to trigger switches.   Human Mira works for her friend BK, a raccoon, at the local donut shop in Donut County. She finds BK more interested in a new mobile app, trying to earn enough points for a quadcopter drone, which he does by scheduling the delivery of donuts to the residents of Donut County. However, Mira discovers that these aren't donuts being set by the app, but actual holes which have been consuming the homes and residents of the place. BK refuses to acknowledge he did anything wrong, and when he receives his quadcopter, Mira purposely destroys it and then orders a donut to the shop, swallowing it up as well. They join the other residents trapped underground, and they all try to reason with BK of what he did was wrong. They come to learn that this was part of the plan of the Raccoon King - to acquire more trash, the Raccoon King and other raccoons developed the app to swallow all the trash it could find, ignoring the whims of the people that lived there. Mira and BK launch a mission to stop the Raccoon King. As Mira uses a hole to wreak havoc within the raccoon's facilities, BK tries to convince the Raccoon King to stop what he is doing. The Raccoon King tempts BK with a lucrative position, while sending a giant quadcopter to fight off Mira. BK rejects the offer and races out to help hack the quadcopter and destroy it, destroying the raccoons' facilities as well.  BK agrees to help return all the people of Donut County back to the surface.  "
300,Doom,/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game),First-person shooter,id Software,Bethesda Softworks,"July 27, 2019","July 26, 2019","July 26, 2019"," Doom is a first-person shooter presented with early 3D graphics. The player controls an unnamed space marine—later termed the Doomguy—through a series of levels set in military bases on the moons of Mars and in Hell. To finish a level, the player must traverse through the area to reach a marked exit room. Levels are grouped together into named episodes, with the final level focusing on a boss fight with a particularly difficult enemy. While the levels are presented in a 3D perspective, the enemies and objects are instead 2D sprites presented from several set viewing angles, a technique sometimes referred to as 2.5D graphics. Levels are often labyrinthine, and a full screen automap is available which shows the areas explored to that point.  While traversing the levels, the player must fight a variety of enemies, including demons and possessed undead humans, while managing supplies of ammunition, health, and armor. Enemies often appear in large groups, and the game features five difficulty levels which increase the quantity and damage done by enemies, with enemies respawning upon death and moving faster than normal on the hardest difficulty setting. The monsters have very simple behavior, consisting of either moving toward their opponent, or attacking by throwing fireballs, biting, and clawing. They will fight each other if one monster is accidentally harmed by another, though most monsters are not harmed by other monsters of the same kind. Levels can also include pits of toxic waste, ceilings that lower and crush anything below them, and locked doors which require a keycard, skull-shaped key device, or a remote switch to be opened. The player can find weapons and ammunition placed in the levels or can collect them from dead enemies; weapons include a pistol, a chainsaw, a plasma rifle, and the BFG 9000, among others. The levels also feature power-ups such as items that give health or armor points, increase the player character's maximum ammunition or health, fill out the automap, give partial invisibility, or allow the player to survive in toxic waste. There are also items which apply time-limited effects such as invulnerability or a berserker status.  In addition to the main single-player game mode, Doom features two multiplayer modes playable over a local network: ""cooperative"", in which two to four players team up to play through the main game, and ""deathmatch"", in which two to four players play against each other. Online multiplayer was later made available a year after launch through the DWANGO service. Doom also contains cheat codes that allow the player to be invulnerable, obtain every weapon, be able to instantly kill every monster in a particular level, and several other abilities.   Doom is divided into three episodes: ""Knee-Deep in the Dead"", ""The Shores of Hell"", and ""Inferno"". A fourth episode, ""Thy Flesh Consumed"", was added in an expanded version of the game, The Ultimate Doom. The game itself contains very few plot elements, with the minimal story instead given in the instruction manual and short text segues between episodes.  In the future, the player character (an unnamed space marine) has been punitively posted to Mars after assaulting a superior officer, who ordered his unit to fire on civilians. The space marines act as security for the Union Aerospace Corporation's radioactive waste facilities, which are used by the military to perform secret experiments with teleportation by creating gateways between the two moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos. Three years later, Deimos disappears entirely and ""something fraggin' evil"" starts pouring out of the teleporter gateways, killing or possessing all personnel. The Martian marine unit is dispatched to investigate, with the player character left to guard the perimeter with only a pistol while the rest of the group proceeds inside the base and is killed. Being unable to pilot the shuttle off of Phobos by himself, he realizes that the only way to escape is to go inside and fight his way through the complexes of the moon base.   As the last man standing, the player character fights through the onslaught of demonic enemies to keep them from attacking Earth. In ""Knee-Deep in the Dead"", he fights through the high-tech military bases, power plants, computer centers and geological anomalies on Phobos. It ends with the player character entering the teleporter leading to Deimos, only to be overwhelmed by monsters. In ""The Shores of Hell"" he fights through installations on Deimos, similar to those on Phobos, but warped and distorted from the demon invasion and interwoven with beastly architecture. After defeating the titanic Cyberdemon, the marine discovers the vanished moon is floating above Hell. ""Inferno"" begins after the marine climbs off Deimos to the surface. The marine fights his way through Hell and defeats the Spider Mastermind that planned the invasion. A hidden doorway back to Earth opens for the hero, who has ""proven too tough for Hell to contain"". However, a burning city and a rabbit's head impaled on a stake (named in The Ultimate Doom as the marine's pet rabbit, Daisy) show that the demons have invaded Earth, setting the stage for Doom II: Hell on Earth. In ""Thy Flesh Consumed"", the marine fights the demons on Earth through a variety of disconnected high-tech bases and demonic temples, though ultimately the forces of Hell prevail in the invasion of Earth.

301,Doom,/wiki/Doom_(2016_video_game),First-person shooter,id Software,Bethesda Softworks,"March 1, 2018","November 10, 2017","November 10, 2017","  Doom takes place during the year 2149 in a research facility on Mars owned by the Union Aerospace Corporation, run by Dr. Samuel Hayden, a UAC scientist whose mind now inhabits an android body after having lost his original to brain cancer. Researchers at the UAC facility have attempted to draw energy from Hell, an alternative dimension inhabited by demons, in order to solve an energy crisis on Earth using the Argent Tower, which siphons energy and allows travel to and from Hell. To supplement their work, Hayden organizes several expeditions into Hell, bringing back captive demons and artifacts for study. Among them is a sarcophagus containing the Doom Slayer (along with his Pradetor Suit), who the demons imprisoned after his earlier rampage through Hell.  The facility is overrun by demons after one of Hayden's researchers, Olivia Pierce, makes a pact with them and uses the Tower to open a portal to Hell. In desperation, Hayden releases the Doom Slayer from his sarcophagus to repel the demonic invasion and close the portal. The Doom Slayer recovers his Praetor Suit and fights his way through the overrun facility, where he realigns a comms satellite dish to get a lay of the land, all guided by the AI VEGA. After clearing out the facility core and preventing a meltdown, he pursues Pierce as he destroys the energy induction filters to Hayden's objections. He pursues Pierce up the tower, where she uses an Argent accumulator to open an explosive rift into Hell, destroying the Tower, and where the Slayer is sent back.   Fighting his way to a teleporter, the Doom Slayer returns to Mars and makes his way to a tram leading to Hayden. Hayden informs the Slayer of the Helix Stone, an artifact used to study and harness Hell's energy. Entering the Lazarus labs, he observes the Helix Stone, and he learns of the Well, where the portal is powered, and of the magical key-like blade, the Crucible. He makes another excursion into Hell after battling and defeating a contained Cyberdemon and activating its accumulator, and fights through a labyrinthine gauntlet to recover the Crucible from a trio of Hell Guards. Arriving at VEGA's facility in the frozen north, he destroys the AI (while also making a backup copy), using its power to enter the Well, where he uses the Crucible to destroy the portal's power source. Finally, he confronts Pierce, who is betrayed and transformed by the demons into the monstrous Spider Mastermind, and kills her.  Upon the Doom Slayer's return to Mars, Hayden confiscates the Crucible, which he plans to use in his research. Despite all that has happened, he insists that Earth is too desperate for energy to give up. To keep the Doom Slayer from interfering with his plans, Hayden teleports him to an undisclosed location, saying that they will meet again.  "
302,Doom II,/wiki/Doom_II,First-person shooter,id Software,Bethesda Softworks,"July 27, 2019","July 26, 2019","July 26, 2019"," Doom II was not dramatically different from its predecessor. There were no major technological developments, graphical improvements, or substantial gameplay changes. Instead, the development team took advantage of advances in computer hardware since the release of the original game that allowed them to do more with their game engine by making much larger and more intricate levels. The game still consists of the player navigating large nonlinear levels. Each level is infested with demons that can be killed with a variety of weapons that can be picked up throughout the game. Levels are completed by finding an exit, whether it be a switch or a teleporter; the goal is simply to advance to the next area. As with its predecessor, Doom II's levels can be completed in a straightforward fashion. However, because the levels are nonlinear players can wander off the beaten path, and those that do are often rewarded with bonuses, like health pickups and more powerful weapons. Due to the larger and more complicated maps with larger groups of monsters, the game had somewhat higher system requirements than the original.  Rather than the player playing through three related episodes as in the first Doom, gameplay takes place over one giant episode, albeit with interludes for when the story develops. Instead of watching the player's progress on a map (as in the original episodes of Doom), the screens between each level simply show a background (a style carried over to the bonus fourth episode of Doom available in The Ultimate Doom, the retail re-release of the original Doom). This also means the player is never forced to lose all of their inventory after completing an episode.  Doom II doubled the number of non-boss monster types and started using bosses from the original Doom as normal level enemies, in addition to adding a new weapon, the Super Shotgun (a very powerful double-barreled shotgun), and a new power-up, the Megasphere.   The continuous 30 levels are divided into four areas; UAC Underground, UAC's Starport (Hellish Outpost), City, and Hell.  Immediately following the events in Doom, the player once again assumes the role of the Doom Slayer. After defeating the Spider Mastermind, the demons of hell open a portal to Earth for the marine, as he has ""proven too tough for Hell to contain"". After returning to Earth, the marine finds that it has also been invaded by the demons, who have killed billions of people.  The humans who survived the attack have developed a plan to build massive spaceships which will carry the remaining survivors into space. Unfortunately, Earth's only ground spaceport has been taken over by the demons, who placed a flame barrier over it, preventing any ships from leaving. The marine battles hordes of demons and is able to deactivate the force field, allowing the remaining humans to escape. Once all the survivors have escaped Earth, the marine is the only human left on the planet.  Just as he sits down to await death, knowing that he saved humanity, the marine then receives an off-planet transmission from the survivors in orbit, who have managed to find out where the armies of Hell are coming from. The message reveals that the demonic base is in the center of the marine's own hometown. He then fights through the city until he reaches the base, but sees there is no way to stop the invasion on that side. He decides to step into the portal to try deactivating it from the other side, entering Hell.  After fighting through the hordes of Hell, the marine reaches the location of the biggest demon he has ever seen, called the Icon of Sin (Baphomet). He kills the Icon of Sin by firing rockets into its exposed brain. Its death causes devastation on Hell, and the portal to Earth is sealed.  "

Changes were made to the Doom engine for use in Doom 64, and gameplay elements were altered.   Following the Doom Marine's success thwarting hell in Doom and Doom II: Hell on Earth, a planetary policy is established to quarantine the UAC research installations with apocalyptic levels of radiation. For years, the installations stood motionless and abandoned, until a long forgotten satellite monitoring one of the installations, barely functioning due to years of being subjected to the high levels of radiation, sends a message back to Earth.  The message indicates that a single entity, with vast rejuvenation powers and masked by the extreme radiation levels, managed to escape detection. This entity systematically altered decaying dead carnage back into corrupted living tissue, resurrecting the demons.  As the only experienced survivor of the ""DOOM"" episodes, the Doom Marine is sent in alone to exterminate them. Later, he realizes the demons had planned for this, after he unknowingly allowed himself to be lured back into hell. Despite this, the demons are unable to defeat him, and with the Unmaker, he eventually battles and kills the Mother Demon. The game ends with the Doom Marine, no longer capable of having a normal life following his encounters with hell's forces, deciding to remain in hell forever to ensure no demon ever rises again.  "
305,Doom Eternal,/wiki/Doom_Eternal,First-person shooter,id Software,Bethesda Softworks,2020,2020,2020," Players once again take on the role of the Doom Slayer, an ancient warrior who battles the demonic forces of Hell, from a first-person perspective. The game continues its predecessor's emphasis on ""push-forward"" combat, encouraging the player to aggressively engage enemies in order to acquire health, ammo, and armor. The player has access to various firearms, such as the Combat Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Heavy Cannon, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Rifle, BFG 9000, and Ballista. Melee weapons such as a chainsaw, the ""Crucible Blade"" energy sword and a retractable arm-blade called the ""Doomblade"" can also be used. The arm-blade provides the opportunity for a larger variety of quick and violent ""glory kill"" executions, which drop extra health. The Super Shotgun is now equipped with the ""Meat Hook"", a ranged accessory which grabs on to enemies and slingshots the player towards them, functioning as a grappling hook, useful both in combat scenarios and environmental navigation. The Doom Slayer's armor now includes a shoulder-mounted Equipment Launcher with the ability to lob grenades and ice bombs. Additionally the Flame Belch is a flame thrower, which causes the enemies set on fire with it to drop armor pickups. Finally, killing enemies with the chainsaw will drop ammunition. New movement mechanics such as wall-climbing, dash moves, and horizontal bars to swing from have also been introduced.  Like its predecessor, Doom Eternal invites the player to develop simple tactics. As the game gets harder, the player needs to use the advantages of fight arenas, and their bonuses, smarter. They also need to decide which enemy has to be killed first and how to move on the battlefield.  Creative director Hugo Martin has stated there would be twice as many demon types as in the 2016 reboot. There are new types of enemies, such as the Marauder and Doom Hunter, while others, such as the Pain Elemental, Arachnotron, and Archvile, have been reintroduced from previous Doom entries. A new system called ""Destructible Demons"" is featured, in which enemies' bodies become progressively destroyed and deteriorated in combat as they suffer damage. Through this system, certain parts of a demon's anatomy can be destroyed to eliminate their ability to use their stronger attacks. There is also a new lives system. During gameplay, players can collect 1-up items (which look like green helmets) scattered around the environment. When the Doom Slayer perishes in combat, he will respawn where he died if he has spare lives, instead of restarting at the nearest checkpoint.  The game features several asymmetric multiplayer modes, including ""Battlemode"". This game type is a 2v1 PvP multi-round match where two player-controlled demons take on one fully loaded Slayer. There are five playable demons at launch, with more to be included in free updates post-launch. The five initially available demons are the Marauder, Mancubus, Pain Elemental, Revenant, and Arch Vile. In addition to regular attacks, each demon has a ""summoning wheel"", which contains a selection of four additional abilities. An additional mode, called ""Invasion"", is also in the works, and is expected to be released as a free post-launch update. In this mode, players will be able to join others' single-player campaigns, fighting against them as demons. This mode can be turned off by players who wish to play the game solo.  Also new to the game is the hub area, called ""Fortress of Doom"", which players can visit between missions, containing a number of rooms with upgrades and gear locked behind doors. Players can also unlock a bonus weapon, the Unmaykr, after clearing six challenging Slayer Gates.   Sometime after the events on Mars, Earth has been overrun by demonic forces, wiping out most of the planet's population, under the now-corrupted Union Aerospace Corporation. What remains of humanity has either fled Earth or have joined the Armored Response Coalition, a resistance movement formed to stop the invasion, which has gone into hiding after suffering heavy losses. The Doom Slayer, having previously been betrayed and teleported away by Dr. Samuel Hayden, returns with a satellite fortress controlled by the AI VEGA to quell the demonic invasion by killing the Hell Priests: Deags Nilox, Ranak, and Grav. The priests serve an angelic being known as the Khan Maykr who seeks to sacrifice mankind. The Slayer teleports to a destroyed city and kills Deag Nilox, but the Khan Maykr transports the two remaining priests to unknown locations, forcing the Slayer to continue searching.  After retrieving a celestial locator from the Sentinel world of Exultia, the Slayer travels to Hell to retrieve a power source from an exiled Sentinel known as the Betrayer, who gives him the power source and a special dagger. VEGA directs the Slayer to Deag Ranak's citadel in the Arctic, where the Slayer kills him. In response, the Khan Maykr moves Deag Grav to a hidden location and accelerates the invasion of Earth. With no leads on finding the last Hell Priest, VEGA suggests finding Dr. Hayden, who knows his location. The Slayer goes to an ARC compound where he retrieves Hayden's damaged robot chassis and the demonic crucible.  Upon uploading Hayden's mind into the fortress, he reveals Deag Grav is hiding on Sentinel Prime, the only way to get there being a portal located in the city of Hebeth in Mars' core. The Slayer travels to a facility on Phobos where he uses the BFG 10000 to shoot a hole in Mars, which he uses to reach Hebeth. After reaching Sentinel Prime, flashbacks reveal the Slayer to be Doomguy. Found badly wounded by Sentinels, Doomguy was brought before the Deags and was forced to fight in a gladiatorial arena. Impressed by Doomguy’s ruthlessness in battle, the Deags inducted him into the Sentinels, while the Khan Maykr inquired into Doomguy's knowledge of the Demons. In the present, the Slayer finds Deag Grav in the arena and kills him, but is excommunicated from the Sentinels for murdering Deag Grav on sacred ground and returns to the fortress.  Upon the Slayer's return, the fortress is shut down remotely by the Khan Maykr to prevent any further interference in her plans. She reveals her intentions to resurrect the world-eating super-demon, the Icon of Sin, to consume mankind. The Slayer uses the demonic Crucible's latent Argent energy to reactivate the fortress and travels to Argent d'Nur to retrieve his own Crucible from his time in the Sentinels. Further flashbacks reveal that during the ill-fated battle of Argent d'Nur, a rogue Maykr known as the Seraphim imbued Doomguy with superhuman abilities, transforming him into the Doom Slayer. After retrieving the hilt of the Slayer Crucible, it is revealed that the Khan Maykr formed an alliance with Hell to produce Argent energy, which is created through the mass sacrifice of human souls. In return for providing worlds for Hell to invade, the Maykrs receive a share of the Argent energy produced by Hell which allows their own dimension, Urdak, to survive.  Hayden directs the Slayer through Hell's massive citadel, Nekravol, until he finds a portal leading to Urdak. He finds the Khan Maykr and halts the awakening ceremony by using the Betrayer's dagger to destroy the Icon's heart. Free from Maykr control, the Icon of Sin awakens and teleports to Earth. With the dimensional barrier destroyed, the demons break their alliance with the Maykrs and proceed to invade Urdak. The Slayer kills the Khan Maykr before returning to Earth to confront the Icon of Sin, although VEGA is left behind to ensure the portal stays open. After an intense battle across the cityscape, the Slayer kills the Icon of Sin by stabbing it in the head with the Crucible, putting an end to Hell's invasion of Earth. As the Slayer walks away, King Novik, leader of the Night Sentinels, states how his fight is ""eternal"".  "

By defeating enemies, Zahra can obtain energy that fills an energy meter, which is used up in some of her combat moves. Zahra also gains new combat moves by collecting enough Upgradium in each level to level up; leveling up also allows Zahra access to certain equippable upgrades of which she can only hold three at a time. The game's visual style is presented through 2D vector character sprites and environments.  There are a grand total of thirteen levels in the game, with four levels in each of the three worlds, and one final level that is only unlocked once all three worlds are cleared and certain other conditions are met. Though the levels in each world are structured linearly, the player may complete each world in any order they wish barring the final level, similar to the Mega Man series. The first three levels of each world are unlocked by normal progression, but to reach the fourth and final level of each world as well as the final level, the player must gather clues by completing requests for other characters, completing certain levels, or simply checking various areas in the RIFT headquarters, to gather a complete case file to send to Commissioner Valerie Wiseheart. Each world has a distinct gameplay mechanic that is interspersed into its levels.   Double Cross takes place in a world where interdimensional travel is possible. However, as this has led to negative consequences such as crime and contamination between worlds, a police force led by Valerie Wiseheart and Dash Sterling known as Regulators of Interdimensional Frontiers and Technology (RIFT) serves to maintain law and order between each dimension, with Zahra Sinclair being one of RIFT's top agents.  One day, a mysterious figure referred to as ""Suspect X"" steals the Metacatalyst, a weapon said to be majorly destructive, from the Extraverse. When Zahra arrives to stop him, ""X"" tells her to ""leave RIFT"" before escaping. Using the clues she obtained while confronting ""X"", and with the help of her coworkers, Zahra tracks ""X""'s activities to Reptarria, the Funderdome, and Gootopia.  Zahra clears the trials of each world and respectively defeats crime bosses Ripjaw, Hancho, and even RIFT's own Freya Gronnalva, narrowing down her suspect list; as she does this, Zahra runs into a counterpart of herself who despises both ""X"" and RIFT because of an incident where ""X"" destroyed her world, and is herself horrified at RIFT's corruption. Zahra eventually narrows down her suspect list to her best friend, Skip Hollister, much to her chagrin.  After Zahra faces off against Rogue Zahra one last time, it is revealed that the real ""X"" had framed Skip to commence his invasion of the RIFT headquarters and overheat the station core. With some help from Skip, Zahra confronts ""X"", who is revealed to be a counterpart of Dash. RIFT's Dash then enters the scene, and reveals that he had staged the whole heist to get revenge on RIFT (especially strict director general Sorgina DeLabourde) for not treating his terminally ill son, the one person he loved more than anyone else in any universe. Zahra fights both Dashes with much difficulty; however, Rogue Zahra appears at the last moment and allows RIFT's Zahra to gain the upper hand, defeating the Dashes and foiling their scheme. Zahra is later promoted to elite agent to ensure RIFT is reformed, and celebrates with the other agents as Rogue Zahra thanks her counterpart for helping come to terms with their differences.  In a post-credits scene, an army of the remaining Dashes decide to enact revenge on behalf of their jailed counterparts.  "

Knowing that monsters are waiting for him inside, he straps on his gunboots and starts his trip downwards, killing his enemies to proceed and collect treasure. The game features three basic controls: movement to left and right, and the ability to jump while on a solid surface. When mid-air, the player may press and hold the jump button down to fire from Welltaro's gunboots. Downwell is completely presented in a palette consisting of three colors, which default to black background and white outlines, with red as a highlight for gems, enemies and other important items. The precise colors are interchangeable through unlockable in-game palettes.  Downwell's art style and underground level design have been compared to  Spelunky and Cave Story. The well is procedurally generated, and the player is often confronted with a large number of different types of enemies, most of which can either be shot with the gunboots or stomped by jumping on them; others, however, are resistant to being stomped and can thus only be killed with bullets. While normal enemies only feature a red glare alongside the white outlines, these particular enemies are completely highlighted in red, with a more filled sprite body. The gunboots are automatically reloaded when Welltaro hits a surface, regardless of whether or not it is solid. During the descent, players will find ""timevoids"", which, upon entering, stop everything outside them, as well as the music. These timevoids may lead to caves, which provide the player with a large amount of gems, or with an alternate weapon, which influences speed, delay, ammo usage, ammo count and the shoot pattern of the gunboots, as well as providing either health or a max ammo upgrade. In other cases, the timevoids lead to a shop, where Welltaro is welcomed by a Jizō, who is taking the place of a shopkeeper, offering the player three different items in exchange for gems.  The well is built up from multiple stages, each of them having three levels and featuring different sets of environmental designs and enemies. At the end of each level, the player is given the choice between three Welltaro upgrades, which persist throughout the play session and support the player, in addition to ammo upgrades or shop purchases. Additionally, alternating with color palettes unlocks, the player unlocks different movement styles, which influence Welltaro's position and movement animation while on solid ground, as well as some of the well's procedural attributes, like frequency and type of timevoids.

313,Dragon Ball FighterZ,/wiki/Dragon_Ball_FighterZ,Fighting,Arc System Works,Bandai Namco Entertainment,"September 27, 2018","September 28, 2018","September 28, 2018"," The gameplay is inspired by concepts from several other fighting games, namely the control scheme and team mechanics. Players each select three characters to form a team, from an initial roster of characters from the Dragon Ball franchise. One character is controlled and can be switched with one of the other characters at any time. Players can also call one of their other characters to perform an ""Assist"" move, allowing simultaneous attacks and combos with the entire team. All three of the opponent's characters must be defeated to win the game.  In addition to the unique moves of each character, players have several universal moves available. With the ""Vanish Attack"", the player can expend Ki to instantly teleport behind an opponent's character and strike them in the back. This has multiple uses, from bypassing enemy projectiles to moving quickly around the stage, or extending a combo. The ""Dragon Rush"" move can break through an opponent's guard and if successful, offers a choice between an aerial combo or forcing the opponent to switch to a different character. The ""Super Dash"" flying attack will home in on the opponent's lead character and is able to pass through weaker projectiles. Lastly, players can ""Ki Charge"" to manually increase their Ki gauge, similar to previous Dragon Ball fighting games.  The game includes several other features, such as ""Come on Shenron!"", that allows players to gather the Dragon Balls one by one as the fight progresses by special moves and combos. Once all seven are assembled and a player performs a specific attack under certain conditions, Shenron appears to grant a wish and allows players to choose one among the following benefits: increasing their fighter's strength, reviving a fallen ally, recovering a fighter's health or regenerating health for the rest of the match. Another feature is the ""Dramatic Finishes"", special cutscenes that appear at the end of a fight depending on the characters involved and stage, related to events from the Dragon Ball series, which can be applied after using Standing Hard normal attack or Vanish (as of Season 2) as the finisher/combo ender.  Season 3 allows players to choose three different Assist types before the match. Also in the said season, Sparkling Blast properties and its time limit enhanced even further if one of the player’s team members are down.  Dragon Ball FighterZ features a ranking system in both its arcade mode as well as in online multiplayer, where players increase their rank with subsequent wins.   The game takes place sometime between ""Universe 6"" and ""Future Trunks"" arcs of Dragon Ball Super. The game's main antagonist, Android 21 (or later, her evil-half), was a normal female human who eventually became an Android created by the Red Ribbon Army after her son became the model for Android 16. Once she awakens, she repairs 16 and uses the Dragon Balls to resurrect Frieza, Cell, Nappa, and the Ginyu Force, and seals away the powers and souls of all of Earth's strongest warriors. Wanting to control the hungry monster within her, she and 16 develop a linking system originally created by Dr. Gero in which a human soul (the player) can possess the warriors and provide them strength.

314,Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2,/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Xenoverse_2,Fighting,Dimps,Bandai Namco Entertainment,"September 7, 2017","September 22, 2017","September 22, 2017"," The game is very similar to its predecessor in terms of gameplay. It is primarily set in 3D battle arenas modeled after notable locations in the Dragon Ball universe, with the central hub being an expanded version of Toki-Toki City, known as Conton City. As reported by the creators of the game, Conton City is seven times larger than Toki-Toki City. Players are able to freely traverse the hub world, and in some areas are capable of flying, once they have unlocked the ability to fly. Players are also able to travel to other hubs such as the Namekian Village and Frieza's ship. Some skills will have to be learned through masters, like the previous game, some of whom are found exclusively in these extra hubs. Xenoverse 2 is the fourth Dragon Ball video game to feature character customization, and allows players to choose from five races: Humans, Saiyans, Majins, Namekians and Frieza's race, each with different strengths and weaknesses. The game also features race-specific quests, minigames, and transformations (the latter of which was available only to Saiyans in the first game, via the Super Saiyan forms). Players also have a much greater role in the story, as their choices can effect how the story unfolds. Multiplayer servers are now able to hold up to 3000 players at once. The game also has a training mode called Training School. The player can use different kinds of ki blasts (Power, Homing, Rush, Paralyze and Bomb), and the ki blast type depends on the player's race or Super Soul. Additionally, players are able to transfer their save data from Dragon Ball Xenoverse. This results in the player's custom character from the previous game appearing as Toki Toki City's ""Hero"" in the middle of the square. Players may also select a premade avatar to serve as the ""Hero"" if they choose not to transfer save data.   Two years after the events of Dragon Ball Xenoverse, the protagonist receives a special mission from Elder Kai, which involves correcting history after it has changed. On the way there, they meet the Supreme Kai of Time, a deity who watches over time, and her bird, TokiToki. After meeting Elder Kai, they are granted their first mission, which is to correct Goku's battle with Raditz after he's been enhanced by dark magic. Meanwhile, Towa and Mira, who've caused history to change, have gathered allies, including Turles, Lord Slug, and a mysterious masked Saiyan, later revealed to be Goku's father, Bardock, from different parts of the timeline.  During the Attack of the Saiyans Saga, Turles attempts to intercept Goku to prevent him from assisting the Z Fighters against Nappa and Vegeta, only to be stopped by the combined forces of the Time Patroller and Goku. During the battle, Trunks and his partner, the protagonist from the first Xenoverse game, try to capture Turles, but he escapes before the Time Patroller can stop him. The protagonist then returns to the Time Nest after defeating Great Ape Nappa and Great Ape Vegeta, and correcting history. There, they are introduced to Trunks and his partner, and it is announced that TokiToki is laying an egg, which gives birth to another universe. During the Namek Saga, the Time Patroller helps Gohan and Krillin  from escaping from Dodoria and Zarbon. After the battle Lord Slug appears and fights the Time Patroller. After the battle, the Time Patroller returns to the Time Nest only to find out that Captain Ginyu had switched bodies with Vegeta instead of Goku. The Time Patroller and Trunks attempt to fix this but in doing so, Ginyu switches bodies with Trunks. After the mishap, Ginyu finally switches bodies with Goku. (As part of the original timeline). After fighting the Ginyu possessed Goku, Ginyu returns to his body and attempts to switch bodies with the Time Patroller but Goku throws a Namekian frog in the beam, causing Ginyu to switch bodies with the frog. The Time Patroller must then help Nail fight Frieza in order for Gohan and Krillin to obtain the Dragon Balls, causing Trunks to intervene and help Gohan and the Time Patroller. During Goku´s fight with Frieza, Cooler, Freiza´s brother, arrives to help Frieza kill Goku, but is eventually defeated by the Time Patroller and Goku. Afterwards in the Androids era, Trunks tries to help Gohan defeat the Androids once and for all, but is stopped by the Time Patroller due to the Supreme Kai of Time stating that history would be changed. Because of this, Trunks must take a break from time patrolling. The Time Patroller then travels to the Majin Buu era to fix the distortion in which Majin Vegeta sacrificed himself to defeat Majin Buu. Broly arrives, consumed by Towa's dark energy, and attempts to kill Goku, Vegeta, and Buu, but is stopped by the Time Patroller. Vegeta sacrifices himself to destroy Majin Buu, restoring the current flow of history. The Time Patroller then goes to the timeline where Goku and Vegeta defeat Kid Buu, learning that the Masked Saiyan is there collecting energy from the fighters. The Time Patroller chases after him and teleports to the era where Beerus and Goku are fighting. The Time Patroller defeats the Sayian, breaking his mask and revealing him to be Bardock. Mira arrives and engages in battle with the Time Patroller. Beerus interrupts the battle with the intention to destroy Mira, Goku, the Time Patroller, and Earth. The Supreme Kai of Time tries to calm Beerus down with her pudding, but the horrible taste drives Beerus into a fit of rage, and he is subdued by Whis and the Time Patroller. Soon after, the Time Patroller travels to the Golden Frieza Saga, in which Frieza has been resurrected and wants revenge on Goku. During the battle, Cooler shows up again, consumed by dark energy, and Frieza is consumed as well while in his Golden Form. Towa hacks into the Time Nest and tricks Beerus and Whis into leaving the battle, which allows Frieza to destroy the planet. Whis is able to rewind time and the Time Patroller, along with Goku and Vegeta, kill Cooler and Frieza.  Later, Beerus and Whis train the Time Patroller preparing him for the final battle with Towa and Mira. Trunks and the Time Patroller go to an unidentified timeline and battle the mind controlled Bardock. Mira arrives and battles the two, and Bardock is knocked back to his senses. He drags Mira into a time rift and both appear to disappear. Towa then arrives and reveals that she has taken control of Trunks' partner. The Time Patroller and Trunks battle the two and retrieve the mask which Trunks' partner was wearing. Trunks' partner then vanishes from existence, leaving Trunks and the Time Patroller with no memory of him. The scrolls then pick up another distortion in time, causing Trunks to remember his partner and realizes that Towa went back in time to prevent Trunks from summoning him. The Time Patroller fixes this distortion and Trunks' partner is revived. Towa then arrives at the Time Nest, and steals TokiToki's egg. Mira returns (Bardock defeats Mira as a Super Saiyan 3 but left him afterwards) and easily disposes of Trunks and his partner. The Time Patroller confronts Mira, who has become more powerful, finally gaining a fighting spirit because of his battle with Bardock. Towa realizes that Mira's power core is overheating, and would destroy the entire universe should it explode, and so she helps the Time Patroller defeat Mira. When Towa suggests fixing Mira's power core, he turns on her and absorbs her and the egg, gaining incredible power. Goku arrives and turns Super Saiyan Blue and helps the Time Patroller finally destroy Mira. With the universe saved, the Dragon Balls are used to summon a feast for all of Conton City. The game ends with Goku suggesting that the Time Patroller and the Time Patroller from the first game fight each other to see who is stronger.  "
315,Dragon Quest,/wiki/Dragon_Quest_(video_game),Role-playing,Square Enix,JP,"September 27, 2019","September 27, 2019","September 27, 2019"," Dragon Warrior is a role-playing video game. Its gameplay mechanics have been described, years after its release, as simplistic and spartan. Players control a young hero who sets out to defeat a being known as the Dragonlord. Before starting the game, players are presented with a menu which allows them to begin a new quest (a game), continue a previous quest, or change the speed in which messages appear on the screen. In the Japanese version, continuing a quest requires players to enter a password; in the North American Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) English version, the quest is saved onto the game cartridge's battery-backup (known in the game as an ""Adventure Log"" in the ""Imperial Scrolls of Honor""). The English version also has options to delete or duplicate a saved quest. If players choose to start a new quest, they may give the hero any name they wish in either Japanese kana or English letters depending on the version. The hero's name has an effect on his initial ability scores and their statistical growth over the course of the game. Each stat falls into one of two categories, one with faster growth than the other, and the game determines which path each stat uses with a formula based on the kana or letters in the character's name.  Dragon Warrior presents players with a clear objective from the start and uses a series of smaller scenarios to increase the hero's strength in order to achieve the objective. The game begins in King Lorik's chamber in Tantegel Castle, where the hero receives information about the Dragonlord, whom he must defeat, and the stolen Balls of Light, which he must retrieve. After receiving some items and gold, the hero sets out on his quest. Much of Dragon Warrior is spent talking to townspeople and gathering information from them that leads to additional places, events, and secrets. Players are advised to take notes of these hints for future reference. Towns contain shops that sell improved weapons and armor; general stores where the player may buy other goods; inns that allow the hero to recover his health and magic, and shops that offer keys for purchase. Players may sell items at half price to shops that provide weapons, armor, or general goods. The hero's status window is shown whenever he stops moving, displaying his current experience level (LV) and the number of hit points (HP), magic points (MP), gold (G), and experience points (E).  To safely progress to the next areas in the game, players need to accumulate experience points and gold by defeating enemies outside of towns – in the overworld and in dungeons. Apart from the Dragonlord's castle, there are no physical restrictions on where players can roam. Instead, monsters increase in difficulty as players venture further from Tantegel castle. As the hero's level increases, players can explore further afield with less risk. Enemies appear in random encounters and the hero fights one opponent at a time. The encounter rate is lowest on fields and increases in forests and hills. Battles are turn-based and fought from a first-person perspective while the hero remains off-screen. In combat, players must defeat the enemy by reducing its HP to zero. During combat, players have four commands: ""fight"", ""run"", ""spell"", and ""item"". The ""fight"" command causes the hero to attack the enemy with a weapon, or with his bare fists if no weapon is available, in an attempt to inflict damage. With the ""run"" command, the hero attempts to escape from a battle, which is recommended if his HP is low. The ""spell"" command casts magic that can, for example, heal the hero or damage the enemy. The ""item"" command uses herbs that replenish the hero's HP.  During combat, the hero loses HP when he takes damage, and the display turns red when his HP is low. If his HP falls to zero, he dies and is taken back to King Lorik to be resurrected, and loses half his gold ""as punishment."" If the hero succeeds in defeating an enemy, he gains experience points and gold; if he gains enough experience points, his experience level increases, giving him greater strength, agility, speed, and the ability to use magic spells. Every time a spell is used, the hero's MP decreases, with different spells costing different amounts of MP. Both HP and MP can be restored by resting at an inn. Additionally, a non-player character can replenish the hero's MP in Tantegel Castle. As the hero earns more gold, he can purchase better weapons, armor, and items. However, players have limited inventory space to hold items, so they must manage their item collection conservatively. The caves which the hero explores are dark and require the use of a torch or the ""RADIANT"" spell to display a temporary field of vision around the character. In the English version, players can return to King Lorik at any point to save the quest. Because the Japanese version does not have a battery backup, players receive a password to return to a quest at a later time.  The control pad may be used to move the hero in any direction and to move the flashing cursor in menu displays. Additional buttons confirm and cancel commands. In the English version, players use menu commands to talk to people, check their status, search beneath their feet, use items, take treasure chests, open doors, and go up or down stairs. However, in some of the game's later remakes, certain commands were assigned to buttons, navigating stairs became automatic, and the hero's speed was increased. In the Japanese version, characters always face forward, so players must choose a command and then a direction in which to perform that action. In the North American version, the hero turns to face the direction he is moving, making direction selection unnecessary.   Dragon Warrior's plot is a twist on saving a princess from a dragon, in that the player doesn't even have to meet with or speak with her to complete the game.  "
316,Dragon Quest II,/wiki/Dragon_Quest_II,Role-playing,Square Enix,JP,"September 27, 2019","September 27, 2019","September 27, 2019"," Dragon Quest II is a role-playing video game. It allows the player to control more than one character, each of whom has their own characteristics, and it is the first game in the Dragon Quest series to do so. The game introduced a party system where, instead of beginning the game with an entire party as was common in previous computer RPGs, the player begins the game with only one character and gradually recruits more party members during the course of the game. The player controls his or her characters as they move in the game world. They can search treasure chests, talk and trade with villagers, equip themselves with weapons and armor, and cast spells.  While wandering fields, towers, caves, seas, and dungeons, the player randomly encounters monsters, after which the game shifts to battle mode. The game's battle mode introduces groups of monsters, which is an upgrade from the one-on-one battles of Dragon Quest. In the battle mode, the player gives orders to the characters on how to fight the monsters. Once the player defeats all of the monsters, the characters gain experience points and gold. The experience points raise the characters' experience levels. This improves the characters' attributes, and they may also learn new spells.  To win, the player must fight monsters to improve the characters' experience levels and get gold to buy better weapons and armor. Eventually, the player's characters become strong enough to make it to the next town or dungeon. This repeats until the player reaches the final boss and defeats him. However, the gameplay is not necessarily linear, especially after the player gets the boat. Exploration is a key component of the game. The game offers a few spots to save the game. In most of the towns, talking to a king or minister saves the game. In the American version, which incorporated a battery for saved games rather than the password system of the original, talking to the king also allows for the deletion and moving of saved games.  Dragon Quest II is noted for greatly expanding upon the gameplay of the previous game, Dragon Quest. The game is the first in the series to feature multiple heroes and enemies in a battle, as well as a sailing ship. It also allowed the player to land the ship anywhere, making it possible to explore the entire game world in an open-ended manner. It included other new gameplay features such as weapons which cast spells when used in battles. Compared with its predecessor, Dragon Warrior II offers a wider array of spells and items and a much larger world. The game also expanded the inventory management system of its predecessor by giving each character an individual inventory that holds up to eight items, placing a greater emphasis on conservative item management between the characters. Dragon Quest II: Luminaries of the Legendary Line was also the first Dragon Quest game to include a game of chance (played with Lottery Tickets that the player finds), and was also the first Dragon Quest game to use multiple key types and to include travel doors (warp gates).   Dragon Quest II is set one hundred years after Dragon Quest. The story begins with an attack upon Moonbrooke Castle by the wizard Hargon, who seeks to summon the demon Malroth to destroy the world. A wounded soldier escaped the battle and fled to the kingdom of Midenhall, where he informs the king of the attack before he dies. The king then commands his son, who is a descendant of Erdrick (known as Loto in Japanese translations and some later localizations), to defeat Hargon.  The Prince begins his quest alone, but is later joined by two cousins: the Prince of Cannock and the Princess of Moonbrooke. After finding the Prince of Cannock, who began a similar journey at the same time as the Prince of Midenhall, they restore the Princess of Moonbrooke to her human form, having been transformed into a dog during Hargon's assault on Moonbrooke Castle, which was reduced to ruins. As the trio quest to find and defeat Hargon, they secure a ship that allows them to travel across oceans to reach new continents, including Alefgard, which is where Dragon Quest took place. There they meet the grandson of Dragonlord, the villain from the previous game, who gives the party valuable information. He tells them that by collecting the five crests hidden around the world, the party can create the Charm of Rubiss, allowing them to defeat Hargon and his illusions. After obtaining the Charm of Rubiss, the party travels to Hargon's castle in the ice-covered plateau of Rhone and confronts Hargon in his throne room. Hargon is defeated, but he offers himself to Malroth and the demon emerges to destroy the heroes. Together, the three heroes slay Malroth and return to Midenhall, where the Prince is named the new king.  "
317,Dragon Quest III,/wiki/Dragon_Quest_III,Role-playing,Square Enix,JP,"September 27, 2019","September 27, 2019","September 27, 2019"," Dragon Quest III is noted for greatly expanding upon the gameplay of the original Dragon Quest and Dragon Quest II. The game uses basic role-playing video game conventions such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items. The battle system is turn-based like the other games in the series, though the remakes incorporate various interface changes from later titles. These include simpler door opening, a bag to store items instead of keeping them at a bank, quick item sorting with ""Tidy Item"" and ""Tidy Bag"" command, and a ""Full HP"" command to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells. And while earlier Dragon Quest games were non-linear in structure, Dragon Quest III featured an even more open-world experience. It also allowed the player to freely swap characters in and out of their party and introduced the day/night cycle in which certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at specific times of the day.  "
318,Dragon Quest X,/wiki/Dragon_Quest_X,Role-playing,Square Enix,Square Enix,"September 21, 2017",Unreleased,Unreleased," Dragon Quest X is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), where a customized player character travels the world of Astoltia completing quests and fighting monsters. While starting out as a human character, the player character is later transferred into the body of one of five available tribes: the powerful Ogre, the inquisitive Puklipo, the aquatic Weddie, the forest-dwelling Elves, and the mining Dwarfs. Humans populate multiple settlements across Astoltia. Later versions added an additional Dragon race. The game utilizes cloud storage for save files and other game data. As with most MMORPGs, Dragon Quest X requires a subscription fee to access, however there is a daily two-hour window dubbed ""Kid's Time"" where players can access and play the game free of charge.  Battles are triggered when the player encounters an enemy in the overworld. Battles take place in a themed arena, using a version of the Active Time Battle system: each side is given a turn in which to perform an action such as attacking. Each side can also interrupt an opponent's action, prolonging their waiting time. At the end of battle, players are granted experience points, which raise their experience level and boost their maximum health and statistics, in addition to in-game currency. Players can form a three-strong party to fight monsters, explore and battle alone, or loan non-active player characters of a similar or lower experience level for a fee, which are then controlled in battle by the game's artificial intelligence. Any character can be loaned to three different people, and the loaned character keeps the experience points and gold that they have earned.  Player characters' combat abilities and skills are dictated by a character class-based job system. The jobs in the initial launch were Warrior, Priest, Mage, Martial Artist, Thief, and Minstrel. Later updates added further jobs, such as the Beast Tamer and Dancer. Each job has a separate skill point system that allows customization, and jobs can be changed at dedicated temples found in each major town. Player characters can also adopt Trades, skills that include woodwork, weapon and armor forging among others. Each Trade skill requires materials gathered from the overworld, which are then used to create a specific type of equipment unique to the gathered materials and Trade. Weapons and items are acquired either in battle alongside in-game currency or through Guilds scattered through Bazaars located in major towns. Guilds will forge new gear, weapons and items for a combined fee of money and materials salvaged from the game world. Also found in towns are vendors where excess items can be stored, merchants which buy and sell various items, and tailor's establishments where the player character can gain new outfits.  "
319,Dragon Quest XI S,/wiki/Dragon_Quest_XI_S,Role-playing,Square Enix,JP,"September 27, 2019","September 27, 2019","September 27, 2019"," Dragon Quest XI continues the gameplay of previous games in the series, in which players explore worlds and fight against various monsters, including the ability to explore high areas. The Nintendo 3DS version features a different style to the other versions, showcasing 3D graphics on the top screen and 16-bit styled sprites on the bottom screen. Before entering battle, players can also toggle between the 3D and 2D graphical styles at any time. Like with Dragon Quest IX, on land the game's battle system features no random encounters and shows all enemies on the overworld. The battle system also adds a free-form camera option inspired by the MMORPG Dragon Quest X that allows players to move around the enclosed battlefield, although it is purely visual and provides no other benefits to gameplay.   The game is set in the world of Erdrea, and begins as the kingdom of Dundrasil is invaded and destroyed by an army of monsters. The protagonist, an infant during the attack, survives and is found floating down a river by an old man named Chalky in the village of Cobblestone. The protagonist is adopted by Chalky's daughter Amber and raised in the village. After the protagonist's coming-of-age ceremony, Amber reveals the truth to him about his birth and adoption, and sends him to meet King Carnelian of Heliodor. However, the king accuses him of being an evil entity and throws him into the dungeons. Imprisoned, the protagonist meets a thief called Erik who reveals that he was sent to meet him, as the mark on his hand is proof that he is the Luminary, a legendary hero chosen by the world tree Yggdrasil to save Erdrea from evil. The pair escape and evade capture, later joined by two mages: Veronica, who is trapped in a child's body due to a curse, and her twin sister Serena. On their quest to help the Luminary reach the sacred tree Yggdrasil, they gain three other companions: Sylvando, a traveling entertainer, Rab, former king of Dundrasil and the protagonist's grandfather, and Jade, exiled princess of Heliodor who helped the infant protagonist escape during the attack of Dundrasil.  The party eventually arrives at the heart of Yggdrasil, which contains the Sword of Light, the Luminary's destined weapon. However, just as the Luminary is about to take it, he and the party are intercepted by Carnelian and his retainers Jasper and Hendrik. It is revealed that Carnelian was possessed by an evil sorcerer known as Mordegon and that Jasper is Mordegon's agent. The two subdue Hendrik and the Luminary's party, with Mordegon taking the Sword of Light and absorbing the heart of Yggdrasil, destroying the tree and plunging the world into an age of darkness. Separated from the others, the Luminary returns to Cobblestone, turned into a fortified refuge for Heliodor citizens led by Carnelian and Hendrik, who apologize to the Luminary for all the troubles they caused him. Hendrik joins forces with the Luminary, and together they reclaim Heliodor from Mordegon's forces. After reuniting with the rest of the party, except for Veronica, who perished saving the others during the fall of Yggdrasil, the Luminary obtains the means to forge a new Sword of Light, which they use to defeat Jasper and Mordegon, which restores Yggdrasil and the world.  Afterwards, the party discovers the means to bring Veronica back within the Tower of Lost Time. There they meet the Timekeeper, who gives the Luminary the power to go back in time and defeats Mordegon before he can steal the Sword of Light and Yggdrasil's heart, thus saving Veronica from sacrificing herself. However, due to Mordegon's absence, a dark spirit is able to summon forth a mysterious orb called Erdwin's Lantern and merge with it, thus awakening the game's true antagonist, The Dark One, Calasmos, who was previously destroyed in the timeline of Mordegon's rule. The party learns that a prior Luminary named Erdwin was betrayed and killed by his mage companion Morcant, who absorbed Calasmos's powers and transformed into Mordegon. Since he could not be destroyed forever without the power of the Luminary, Serenica, Erdwin's former sage companion and lover, then sealed the weakened Calasmos within Erdwin's Lantern and attempted to return to the past at the Tower of Lost Time, but was turned into the Timekeeper instead. The party then confronts and destroys Calasmos, before the Luminary entrusts his mark to Serenica, who reverts to her original form and uses it to return to the past and reunite with Erdwin. Accompanied by Veronica and Serena, he also returns the Sword of Light to Yggdrasil, who reveals itself to be Yggdragon, an ancient dragon of light who was defeated by Calasmos ages ago, whose body transformed into the tree Yggdrasil and gave life to Erdrea. Yggdragon bestows upon the Luminary the title of ""Erdrick"", the mightiest of all heroes, and keeps the Sword for the day when a new hero will need it to defend Erdrea from evil. In the mid-credits, Serenica reunites with Erdwin in the past, while after the credits, a young mother, after reading the Luminary's story in a book, wakes up her child from bed, setting up the beginning of Dragon Quest III.

Unlike the first Dragon Quest Builders, the game allows for up to four players to play together cooperatively via online play, as well as wireless play on the Switch version. Other new features include an optional first-person perspective, underwater exploration, and gliding. Players are also able to transfer their game data between compatible game consoles and will gain a special bonus for doing so.

The player character escapes, washing up on the Isle of Awakening, where they meet a person named Malroth, who has no memory of his past. Malroth aids the player-character in improving their building powers.  "
323,Dragon Quest Heroes II,/wiki/Dragon_Quest_Heroes_II,Hack and slash,Omega Force,Square Enix,"March 3, 2017",Unreleased,Unreleased," Dragon Quest Heroes II mixes the hack-and-slash combat of Koei Tecmo's Dynasty Warriors series of video games with the characters, monsters, universe, and lore from Square Enix's Dragon Quest series. The game is heavier on the RPG elements than most of Omega Force's other titles. World exploration was changed to resemble the typical Dragon Quest experience. Players can move their party to visit towns, wander the world map and initiate battle stages (similar to dungeons). Seamless random monster encounters may break up the pace between locations. Special ingredients and treasure boxes can be discovered across the world map. Weather can fluctuate and sometimes affect the party's status.  Characters are able to dash to wherever they please, but certain areas are blocked until the player proceeds with the main story. As the players proceed with the main story, they can unlock Zoomstones on the world map. These monuments allow the party to instantly warp to previously visited locations.  Accordia acts as the new main town. One major change from the previous game's features is the class change feature for the main protagonists Lazarel and Teresa. Switching classes changes equipment types and potential skills for each protagonist. Known classes include martial artist, mage, monk, thief and warrior. A new Martial Master can teach new weapon skills to the protagonist, depending on their proficiency with each weapon type. Individual weapons and outfits have all been changed to only provide aesthetic changes. Accessories can still be strengthened to alter stats.  Battle stages are mandatory for progressing the main story and behave like battle areas from the previous title. Parties can still be changed by talking to Patty in her bar. Two player co-op is now available for the main story by selecting the ""Assist"" option in the main battle menu.  Alternatively, players can work together to complete the new ""Time-Space Labyrinth"", a series of multiplayer exclusive stages aiming to appeal to longtime Dragon Quest fans. It is unlocked by finding labyrinth map pieces scattered throughout the main story. Erinn can be spoken to in the town inn to set up online matching or send invites.  Up to four players can play together for multiplayer missions. Online chat is not available, but players can select common stock phrases to communicate. Fallen party members can either be resurrected by Yggdrasil Leaves or raise their alive companions' health and Tension by cheering for them. Players can work together to find more map pieces or defeat difficult bosses. Metal Slimes have a higher chance of appearing in these missions.  Cross-platform play options and save data sharing are present. Having save data from the previous title grants Luceus and Aurora costumes for Lazarel and Teresa. Dragon Quest Builders save data grants ""Builders Mallet"" for the protagonists' use.   The story takes place in the Seven Realms, multiple kingdoms which surround the capital of Accordia. One thousand years prior to the start of the game, the Seven Realms were locked in a brutal war that was brought to an end by the wisdom of a great king named Unos, and his descendants would continue to maintain this peace to the present day.  In the port kingdom of Harba, cousins Lazarel and Teresa (the main protagonists) fend off a sudden and unprovoked invasion from the neighboring kingdom of Dunisia, where their friend Prince Cesar lives. Accompanied by Desdemona, royal guard to the King of Accordia, the cousins travel to Dunisia to confront Cesar, who blames the king of Harba for the murder of his father. The matter is taken to the King of Accordia, who suggests that the four of them launch an investigation into the realm of Ingenia to find the true murderer.  During their travels, Lazarel and Teresa cross paths with various heroes who claim to have come from other worlds (the worlds of past Dragon Quest games). They agree to accompany the cousins as they investigate the growing discontent throughout the Seven Realms, culminating in a full-scale war with the Kings of the Beastlands. After a long and arduous battle, a cease-fire is finally reached and Accordia celebrates the end of the war.  The King of Accordia suddenly appears, accompanied by whom appears to be his twin brother, and declares that humankind is to be sentenced to death. Lazarel and Teresa confront the Kings in Accordia's castle and fight them until one of the twins kills the other. The ""twin"" is revealed to be Fractos, Unos's brother who triggered the war 1,000 years ago and manipulated all the recent events (among them killing Cesar's father) so he could plunge the world into darkness. During the chaos, Lazarel and Teresa realize that they are not cousins as originally thought, but twin siblings and descendants of Unos. Joining their power together, they destroy Fractos and later become the new rulers of Accordia.  "

The game features a simple control scheme: beyond basic movement controls, the player can pick up/throw a weapon, use their equipped weapon, strafe (walk backwards), quack, and trip.

334,Dungeon of the Endless,/wiki/Dungeon_of_the_Endless,Roguelike,Amplitude Studios,Playdigious,Unreleased,"May 15, 2020","May 15, 2020"," Dungeon of the Endless is a roguelike game, featuring procedurally generated levels and the notion of permadeath, so that each runthrough of the game is different. The game is based on directing the survivors of a prison spacecraft (crew, prisoners, and civilians alike), having crash-landed on a strange alien planet, through several levels as to achieve escape from the planet. At the start of each game, the player selects two characters with each character having different statistics such as health, attack, defense power, and movement speed, as well as a number of abilities. The player is able to control each character separately or in tandem by directing them to move to the various rooms on the current level or open doors on that level, as well as to initiate any special ability or to heal them. Otherwise, the characters will act autonomously such as fending off any enemies that enter the room to the best of their ability. On the first level of the game, the characters will start in the crashed escape pod with the power crystal, while on subsequent levels, they will start on the elevator that they took from the previous level.  The game plays out in primarily a turn-based manner, each turn marked when a new door on the level is opened. At the start of each turn, the player gains fixed amounts of three resources: Industry, Science, and Food. Industry is used primarily in the construction of turrets and resource generators; Science is used to research new types of turrets and generators, and Food is used to heal the characters, or increase their experience level which improves their statistics, and gives them new abilities. Certain rooms may have objects that can be scavenged for more of these resources. Furthermore, rooms will have Dust, which powers the crystal. As the crystal gains more power, the player can ""activate"" a limited number of continuous sets of rooms, allowing them to build resource generators and turrets on rooms which have been activated. Players can also deactivate a room at any time to reroute the power to a different room, disabling the turrets and generators in that room. Other rooms may feature item chests, shopkeepers, and research stations, or they may contain survivors that players can recruit to their party (up to 4 characters total).  Opening a new door may also cause monsters to appear, appearing at random rooms across the map in any room that is not activated or lacking its own power source. The monsters will attack both the party and the crystal; killing the creatures has a chance of creating more Dust to run the crystal. The characters will lose health with attacks and will die if it drops to zero, though once all newly spawned monsters are defeated, their health is fully restored. If the crystal is attacked, it will permanently lose Dust, and if this drops to zero, the crystal is destroyed and the game is over. During monster attacks, the player can freely move the characters around between open rooms to obtain the best tactical placement, such as fighting monsters alongside numerous turrets. Once any spawned monsters are defeated, the player can move characters about and build defenses freely until they opt to open the next door.  Once the exit point on the level has been found, the player then must have one character collect the crystal and carry it slowly from the start to the exit point, while other characters protect the carrier from hordes of monsters that appear at this point. If the crystal carrier dies, the game is over, but if all surviving players make it to the room with the exit point, the player advances to the next level. The goal of the game is to complete 12 of these levels, each with more difficult monsters that appear, with at least one character carrying the crystal to the final exit point.  A meta-game exists in that the player can unlock additional characters for starting the game by recruiting new characters they find on levels and either completing the game or three levels with that character alive. Additionally, by achieving certain goals, the player can unlock different gameplay modes, such as one where the characters will start off much stronger than the enemies but will not regain health once a monster wave is defeated, forcing them to rely on food, healing turrets or items to heal.  The game supports online play with up to four players.  Each player controls one character, and each gains separate resources on the opening of new doors. New characters can be recruited by one player if there is space in the party, which are then controlled by that player.  "

Fidget (Kimlinh Tran), the sword's guardian, acts as a companion for Dust and can use magical attacks (such as Spitting on monsters) As the player travels the world, they can acquire power-ups that permanently alter gameplay, such as the ability to double jump or climb to previously unreachable areas or Flying like a tornado. Incorporating elements of role-playing games, Dust can gain experience points by defeating enemies, and in turn may level up. These can be used to raise various attributes, such as health, strength, defense or magic. Non-playable characters can be interacted with throughout the game's world to sell items or receive quests.

Dust is joined by Fidget, a small flying creature called a Nimbat, who just so happens to be the sword's guardian, and sets out for a small town in search of answers.  Upon arriving in Aurora, the group find the town overrun with monsters. The mayor of the town asks Dust for his help, and he tracks down the leader of the enemies, Fuse. Just before he dies, Fuse reveals himself to be a Moonblood, creatures who are victims of a genocide perpetrated by a man known as General Gaius. Fuse also tells Dust that he played a role in the war at some point. Mayor Bram instructs Dust to speak to a woman in Aurora named Ginger, who may have more knowledge of the Moonbloods. She is revealed to be part of a group of Moonblood sympathizers, a group that was recently found and killed by General Gaius's soldiers.  After travelling into the northern mountains, Dust and Fidget come across an abandoned village, where Ginger and the leader of the Moonbloods, Elder Gray Eyes, are waiting. Gray Eyes reveals that Dust was created by the Moonbloods from two people who perished at the same time: Jin (Ginger's brother) and Cassius (an assassin employed by Gaius). These two were exact opposites; Cassius was purely evil but of great skill with the sword, and Jin was completely innocent and good but incapable of defeating Gaius. Their combination together became the Moonblood's ""Sen-Mithrarin"".  The group then heads to the Moonblood base in a volcanic region to the north named Everdawn Basin, where Dust assists the Moonbloods in fighting back Gaius's troops. Reaching the peak of the volcano, Dust fights General Gaius in a lengthy battle. Eventually, Gaius hangs from an outcrop over a pool of lava, where he tells Dust that Cassius is no longer part of him, then throws himself into the lava. Fidget tries to get the exhausted Dust back up, but he refuses, and is consumed by the volcano.  After the battle, Elder Gray Eyes gives a speech to the remaining Moonbloods, telling them that because of Dust's sacrifice, they can now rebuild and live at peace with the rest of the world. During his dialogue, Ginger and Fidget witness a dust cloud, along with the Blade of Ahrah rising out of the volcano and flying off, suggesting Dust may still be alive, and chase after it in hopes of finding him.

347,Empire of Sin,/wiki/Empire_of_Sin_(video_game),Simulation,Romero Games,Paradox Interactive,Unreleased,2020,2020," Empire of Sin plays as a turn-based strategy game with the player taking the role of a crime boss in the Prohibition era, starting anew in 1920 and trying to gain control of Chicago by 1933. As the boss, they can enlist up to 16 underlings from 60 potential ones to manage their empire of questionable businesses, such as speakeasies, casinos, and brothels, protecting them from the law and rival mafia gangs, while trying to extend their own influence by taking over others. The game uses alcohol as a type of currency to extend the empire's influence. Alcohol can be made by breweries under the player's control, given to the player by allies, or rewarded as part of completing various missions. The quality of alcohol can impact its influence; poor quality alcohol can be made cheaply and initially sold at a high profit, but over time will lose its value.  Taking over another business may involve direct combat, during which the game enters a turn-based tactical role-playing game similar to X-Com, or can occur through other persuasive means, including short-term alliances with other gangs to defeat a common foe. Combat and other situations are impacted by various traits and perks the characters have, and may cause them to act differently from the player's orders. For example, a character with the ""Hair Trigger"" trait may fire their weapon rather than moving to cover when ordered. These traits can change over the course of a game; an underling may become more accustomed to solving problems through violent means the more they are put in such conditions, for example.  Controlling more territory gives the gang boss more funds to better arm their underlings or to recruit new members. The game is partially roguelike in nature as the businesses on the game's map reallocate each playthrough, and new characters are generated with different perks each time. Some have compared Empire of Sin as a successor to the 1999 game Mob Rule.  "

Each room contains a set of enemies, which vary in strength, endurance, and attack behavior, where the attack can range from simple, straightforward shots to a complicated mixture of shots fired at the same time. The player may dodge attacks by performing a dodge roll, which was inspired by the Souls series of video games, and are invulnerable during the action, or alternatively flip tables and use them as covers, although tables can be destroyed if they are shot at. The player has a limited number of ""blanks"" for each floor that can be used to eliminate all current projectiles and dealing 10 damage to all enemies in that room, certain items add buffs to ""blanks"". To defeat enemies, the player must use guns, which can be found in chests, won by defeating bosses, or bought at shops scattered around the floors in the Gungeon. The game features over 300 different guns and items that can be combined to achieve more powerful effects called ""Synergies"" that were added in the ""Advanced Gungeons & Draguns Update"". At the end of each floor, a boss awaits the player; beating the boss grants the player a gun or item and currency to spend at shops and unlocks the next floor.

The player can play as eight gungeoneers, each with their own stories and regrets, as they decide to enter the fortress and descend into the Gungeon to seek the legendary gun in order to defeat their past.  As the Pilot goes to his past, it is shown that he ran from an organization named the Imperial Hegemony of Man. Here, the Pilot must destroy a Hegemony battleship that threatens him and his friend. If the Convict goes to her past, it is shown that she resisted arrest from a Hegemony official named Black Stache. The two fight and the Convict flees from jail. If the Hunter goes to her past, she is taken to the moment she was imprisoned by a madman named Dr. Wolfenclaw. The House niter resists and fights the Dr.’s machine-monster. And, If the Marine goes back to the past, he is taken to a galactic laboratory where a monster from another Dimension appears and tries to kill everyone aboard. The Marine slays the beast and is saluted by his comrades.  Once the pasts of all four main characters are killed, the hidden sixth floor, Bullet Hell, is unlocked. There anyone of the characters can fight the master of the Gungeon, the Lich. Once the hero emerges victorious, they are free of the Gungeon’s confines and are set free.   However, after the “Farewell to Arms” update, an alternate ending is added. Once the player unlocks the character named “The Paradox” and kill the Lich with as them, the game will reset at the start. However, this time the player is playing as a character named the Gunslinger. Once the Gunslinger enters his past, he enters Bullet Hell.

The game features both local and online cooperative multiplayer. Two players can assist each other when the player characters are escaping prison. The competitive multiplayer pits four players against each other and the player who breaks out from the confinement facility fastest wins the game.  "

356,Everything,/wiki/Everything_(video_game),Simulation,David OReilly,Double Fine Productions,Unreleased,"January 10, 2019","January 10, 2019"," Everything is a simulation game where the player has the ability to explore a procedurally generated universe and control various objects within it. The player starts as one of many possible creatures and has the ability to move around. Initially, the player can shift their control to any creature or object smaller than the current one they occupy; this shifts the scale of the game to reflect this. Eventually the player can only shift into smaller and smaller parts of matter, down to the sub-atomic level, after which the game then allows the player to shift to larger objects as well. From this point, the player can take forms that include landmasses, planets, and whole star systems. As the player moves and shifts forms, they will find other creatures or objects speaking to them. The game uses a number of levels of ""existence"", representing different length scales, which the player can move between as they shift into different objects.  When a player ""bonds"" with a form for the first time, by moving or ""singing"", that object is added to an in-game encyclopedia catalogued by type. At any time, the player can shift to any form they have already previously inhabited, though this form will be scaled appropriately to the current scale the player is at: taking the form of a planet in the middle of a street will produce a miniature-sized planet. A goal of the game is to complete this encyclopedia and occupy all objects available in Everything. Throughout the game, quotes from philosopher Alan Watts are given to the player. If the player lets the game sit idle, the game will cycle through various scenes on its own. Once the player has completed the game through completing the encyclopedia, they can start in a New Game Plus-type mode, but here starting from any random object in the game.  "

When the player begins his or her adventure there are only two colors, big, simple pixels and a 2D character. Through the adventure, the player gradually unlocks new  graphics, new technologies and new gameplay until reaching the HD age and a three-dimensional world. This evolution in-game of video game history is punctuated by many references to classic role-playing games and movies.  The game alternates between action RPG phases similar to The Legend of Zelda and Active-Time Battles like those seen in Final Fantasy. The character moves in a world made up of dungeons, caverns, forests and villages full of NPCs. Players will collect the in-game currency Glis after each battle, which can be spent in towns to purchase additional items and upgrades, many of which must be obtained to finish the game. In addition to completing the story mode, players can also attempt to find hidden stars and cards that are scattered around the game world, the latter of which can be used in a collectible card game based on ""Triple Triad"" from Final Fantasy VIII.

The player chooses one of four protagonists named the Marine, Convict, Pilot, and Hunter (more can be unlocked as the game progresses), all of whom have different special abilities, such as calling for support or lockpicking chests. A second player is able to join in for co-op mode and control a fifth character (The Cultist)  While the player descends the Gungeon, they are set to go through multiple floors, each with a random number of rooms in it. While the rooms are pre-defined, the constellation of rooms in a floor, the enemies that appear in the rooms, and treasure are procedurally generated. Each room contains a set of enemies, which vary in strength, endurance, and attack behavior, where the attack can range from simple, straightforward shots to a complicated mixture of shots fired at the same time. The player may dodge attacks by performing a dodge roll, which was inspired by the Souls series of video games, and are invulnerable during the action, or alternatively flip tables and use them as covers, although tables can be destroyed if they are shot at. The player has a limited number of ""blanks"" for each floor that can be used to eliminate all current projectiles and dealing 10 damage to all enemies in that room, certain items add buffs to ""blanks"". To defeat enemies, the player must use guns, which can be found in chests, won by defeating bosses, or bought at shops scattered around the floors in the Gungeon. The game features over 300 different guns and items that can be combined to achieve more powerful effects called ""Synergies"" that were added in the ""Advanced Gungeons & Draguns Update"". At the end of each floor, a boss awaits the player; beating the boss grants the player a gun or item and currency to spend at shops and unlocks the next floor.  As the player progresses through multiple playthroughs, they may encounter non-player characters that can be rescued from the Gungeon. Once rescued, these characters take residence at the Breach, a safe level above the Gungeon, and where the player, prior to starting a new playthrough, can spend a type of in-game currency earned from boss fights to permanently unlock special items that will then have a chance of appearing within the Gungeon for all subsequent playthroughs. In the game's ""A Farewell to Arms"" update, a new game mode, Rainbow Mode, assures that each level will contain one rainbow colored chest with a collection of guns in it, but the player can only select one gun from those, and no other chests will be offered; this mode was inspired by self-regulated gameplay popularized within the game's community.   Enter the Gungeon is set in the Gungeon, an eldritch dungeon on a distant planet named Gunymede, inhabited by living bullets and other strange gun-related lifeforms. At an unspecified point in the past, a giant bullet from the sky destroyed a fortress, and its resulting magic created a weapon of legendary proportions: The Gun That Can Kill The Past. The fortress was rebuilt with the highest of security measures to guard the gun, and adventurers known as ""gungeoneers"" hailed from places over the galaxy to claim their chance at changing their past. The player can play as eight gungeoneers, each with their own stories and regrets, as they decide to enter the fortress and descend into the Gungeon to seek the legendary gun in order to defeat their past.  As the Pilot goes to his past, it is shown that he ran from an organization named the Imperial Hegemony of Man. Here, the Pilot must destroy a Hegemony battleship that threatens him and his friend. If the Convict goes to her past, it is shown that she resisted arrest from a Hegemony official named Black Stache. The two fight and the Convict flees from jail. If the Hunter goes to her past, she is taken to the moment she was imprisoned by a madman named Dr. Wolfenclaw. The House niter resists and fights the Dr.’s machine-monster. And, If the Marine goes back to the past, he is taken to a galactic laboratory where a monster from another Dimension appears and tries to kill everyone aboard. The Marine slays the beast and is saluted by his comrades.  Once the pasts of all four main characters are killed, the hidden sixth floor, Bullet Hell, is unlocked. There anyone of the characters can fight the master of the Gungeon, the Lich. Once the hero emerges victorious, they are free of the Gungeon’s confines and are set free.   However, after the “Farewell to Arms” update, an alternate ending is added. Once the player unlocks the character named “The Paradox” and kill the Lich with as them, the game will reset at the start. However, this time the player is playing as a character named the Gunslinger. Once the Gunslinger enters his past, he enters Bullet Hell. At the end, he confronts his future self who was granted immortality and commander of the Gungeon, the Lich, along with a clone of Lich named Paradox Lich. The Gunslinger kills his future self, the Lich, and ultimately, prevents the creation of the Gungeon itself.   "

Natsu Dragneel, a dragon slayer wizard from the Fairy Tail guild, explores the Kingdom of Fiore in search of his missing adoptive father, the dragon Igneel. During his journey, he befriends a young celestial wizard named Lucy Heartfilia and invites her to join Fairy Tail. Lucy forms a team with Natsu and his cat-like Exceed partner, Happy, which is joined by other guild members: Gray Fullbuster, an ice wizard; Erza Scarlet, a magical knight; and Wendy Marvell and Carla, another dragon slayer and Exceed duo . The team embark on numerous missions together, which include subduing criminals, illegal dark guilds, and ancient Etherious demons created by Zeref, an immortal dark wizard.  After several adventures, Natsu and his companions find Zeref living in isolation on Fairy Tail's sacred ground of Sirius Island. A battle over Zeref ensues between Fairy Tail and the dark guild Grimoire Heart, which attracts the attention of the evil black dragon Acnologia. The Fairy Tail wizards survive Acnologia's assault when the spirit of their guild's founder and Zeref's estranged lover, Mavis Vermillion, casts the defensive Fairy Sphere spell that places them into seven years of suspended animation. After later participating in the Grand Magic Games tournament, Fairy Tail wages war against Tartaros, a dark guild of Etherious that aim to unseal a book believed to contain E.N.D., Zeref's ultimate demon. When Acnologia returns to annihilate both guilds, Igneel – revealed to have sealed himself within Natsu – emerges to battle Acnologia, only to be killed in front of a helpless Natsu, who departs on a training journey to avenge Igneel.  After Natsu returns one year later, Fiore is invaded by the Alvarez Empire, a military nation ruled by Zeref, who intends to acquire Fairy Heart, a wellspring of infinite magic power housed within Mavis's preserved body beneath Fairy Tail's guildhall. While battling Zeref, Natsu is informed of his own identity as both Zeref's younger brother and the true incarnation of E.N.D., whom Zeref resurrected as a demon with the intention of being killed by him. When Natsu fails to do so, Zeref absorbs Fairy Heart from Mavis in a bid to rewrite the present timeline with one where he might prevent the atrocities he and Acnologia have caused. After Natsu defeats Zeref to stop the drastic changes to history his actions would create, Mavis lifts her and Zeref's shared curse of immortality by reciprocating his love, which kills them both.  Meanwhile, Fairy Tail and their allies detain Acnologia within a space-time rift created by the use of Eclipse, Zeref's time travel gate. However, Acnologia escapes while his disembodied spirit traps all of the present dragon slayers within the rift to maintain his godlike power. Lucy and the other wizards across the continent immobilize Acnologia's body within Fairy Sphere, while Natsu accumulates the other dragon slayers' magic and destroys Acnologia's spirit, killing him and freeing the dragon slayers from captivity. The following year, Natsu and his team depart on a century-old guild mission, continuing their adventures together.  "
362,The Fall,/wiki/The_Fall_(video_game),Action-adventure,Over the Moon,Over the Moon,Unreleased,"May 10, 2018","May 10, 2018"," After crashing from space into the surface of an unknown planet, a Mark-7 Combat Suit powered exoskeleton activates its Autonomous Robotic Interface Device (A.R.I.D.) artificial intelligence when no response can be detected from the pilot Col. Josephs. With no logs detailing previous mission parameters and the suit's health monitoring system malfunctioning, the A.R.I.D. is given control over the suit's motor functions with the primary directive to seek medical attention for the presumably critically injured and unconscious pilot.  Navigating the decaying lower levels of the industrial facility she finds herself in, the A.R.I.D. is captured and subjected to an evaluation by an android identifying as the Caretaker. She is unable to prove her primary function to the Caretaker because the pilot is non-responsive, so the Caretaker declares her to be faulty and attempts to wipe her using an electromagnetic field so the suit can be ""de-purposed"". Since her and the suit's destruction would place the pilot's life at risk, the A.R.I.D. is given control over the Mark-7 suit's networking functions which she uses to incapacitate the Caretaker and escape.  The A.R.I.D. attempts to explore further into the facility and encounters an intercom terminal which connects her to the Administrator (also referred to as Domesticon's mainframe), the artificial intelligence which operates the facility and has managed to achieve sentience despite being narrowly constrained by his programming. The Administrator abbreviates her model into a name (""Arid"") and explains that the facility is a re-purposing centre for faulty Domesticon Corporation domestic robots. He attempts to let Arid pass through the facility to a medical room on the upper level, but the Caretaker appears and notes that she violated her primary operating protocols by purposely placing her pilot at risk to gain access to the suit's cloaking system.   Unable to lie to the Administrator due to her basic programming barring her from ""misrepresenting reality"", Arid admits to her actions and is declared faulty. Forced to pass re-calibration testing as a domestic robot to avoid being destroyed, Arid undertakes the tests with a significant challenge caused by the decrepit nature of the facility. Operating outside the rules, and with limited assistance from the Administrator, she is able to pass most of the tests but is unable to pass the final challenge which involves submitting to a simulated drunk house guest.   At the suggestion of the Caretaker, Arid descends into the laboratory areas of the facility to find the Administrator's central access panel, because it can be used to override his test protocols which require her to lie. She encounters infestations of dangerous local flora and fauna, which presumably contributed to the facility's abandonment, including: fungi which produce a highly potent acid, piranha-like fish capable of biting through steel, and massive slug creatures. Once she reaches the mainframe's primary access room, the Caretaker appears and sabotages her power systems declaring her faulty and needing to be de-purposed immediately. Arid solicits the Administrator's help to obtain repairs, the Caretaker to re-emerges while Arid is incapacitated in the repair chamber. The Caretaker uses the opportunity to declare the Administrator faulty for assisting her, and implements a complete format on the mainframe, destroying the Administrator's sentience and returning him to his original programming.  Arid pursues the Caretaker through the facility for a final battle, after which her parameter against misrepresenting reality is eliminated. Arid uses this change to successfully pass the final test and reach the surface level of the Domesticon facility. Entering the medical suite, Arid submits to an automated scan of the suit's occupant, and the newly formatted Administrator informs her that there is no human present in the combat suit. She removes her helmet, revealing that Josephs is not in the suit, and states that nothing binds her as the Administrator summons security droids to remove her for recycling. Arid's final two operating parameters, obedience and protecting the active pilot, are deleted as she is partially dismantled and taken away.  "
365,Fallout Shelter,/wiki/Fallout_Shelter,Simulation,Bethesda Game Studios,Bethesda Softworks,Unreleased,"June 10, 2018","June 11, 2018"," In Fallout Shelter, players build and manage their own Vault as an Overseer – the leader and coordinator of their Vault. Players guide and direct the citizens of the Vault, known as dwellers, and need to keep them happy through meeting their needs such as power, food, and water. They rescue dwellers from the wasteland and assign them to different resource-generating buildings in the Vault, using the SPECIAL statistics system from the other Fallout games. Each character's SPECIAL profile affects their ability to generate different resources, and their statistics can be increased by training them in rooms devoted to each stat. The dwellers can level up over time, increasing their health, and can be given new items and weapons to help with various tasks. The number of dwellers can be increased by waiting for new dwellers from the wasteland to arrive or by pairing a male and a female dweller in living quarters to produce babies.  Balancing resources such as food, water, and power is an important aspect of the game. Many different rooms can be built in the Vault, providing different items or stat bonuses. Players are not required to spend money in order to accelerate long timers or processes, instead having the option to instantly complete tasks at the risk of catastrophic failures – such as fires or ""radroach"" infestations. Players are sometimes rewarded with lunchboxes that contain rewards, such as items or resources, which can be purchased separately through microtransactions.  "
368,Fantasy Strike,/wiki/Fantasy_Strike,Fighting,Sirlin Games,Sirlin Games,Unreleased,"July 25, 2019","July 25, 2019"," Fantasy Strike is designed to be less complex than traditional fighting games, having dedicated buttons for every action, including melee, jump/throw, special moves, and a super move. Each player picks a character to play, which are then placed in an arena. By performing various attacks unique to the character, each player tries to bring down their opponents health pool down to zero to win a round. Whoever is the first to win four out of seven rounds is given the match win. In addition to attacks, players can use blocking to defend against attacks and break through blocks by using throws. A unique feature to Fantasy Strike is the ""Yomi Counter"", which can be performed when not attacking by pressing no buttons at all. When yomi countering, if the character is hit by an opponents throw, they won't get hit and instead perform a counter throw, turning the tables.  The game features various modes. Singleplayer pits the player in matches against AI controlled opponents, with different modes putting a different spin on the formula. Arcade adds some story through artwork and dialog, as well as stronger version of the character Midori who serves as the final challenge, Survival provides a stream of progressively stronger opponents. Daily Challenge is similar to Survival, but can only be played once per day and compares the score between the players. Single Match allows a selection of any opponent and difficulty for a standard match. Boss Rush, which was added afterwards for the full release, allows the player to pick up and use power-ups, but introduces special opponents that also possess power-ups and get stronger after each battle.  Multiplayer allows player-against-player matches both locally and online. The latter provides automatic match-making for a casual and a ranked queue, or directly challenging specific opponents through friend matches. Players may either choose to play Standard or Team Battle. Standard refers to the classic mode, where each player picks a character to play a best of seven. Team Battle instead makes each player pick three characters. The game will then randomly pick a character from each players pool of characters, upon which the players play a best of five. The winning player removes his character from his pool. This is repeated until a player has no more characters in his pool, meaning he won with all of his characters and is thus declared the winner. Team Battle is used in ranked play and proposed as the go-to mode for tournaments, as it is designed to alleviate the issue of counter-picking.  In addition to single-player and multi-player modes, there is also a tutorial, a learn section and a training mode. The tutorial should teach new players how to play the game in general, while the learn section contains characters spotlight videos that delve deeper into what to do with each individual character. The training mode is lets player experiment and practice with a character as well as look up frame data in real-time.   The game is set in the world of the same name, ""Fantasy Strike"", a world featured in other games made by Sirlin Games. In the story, Rook hosts a martial arts tournament to rally the strongest fighters of the land.  "

The forest creatures are being attacked by entities called the Silent Ones for unknown reasons that threaten the forest's wildlife. Fe is able to sing to other creatures and objects to gain their help. These creatures can teach Fe a new song which gives the fox additional abilities through the forest, such as activating a flower that acts as a jump-pad to launch Fe to higher locations and explore more of the world.  The game has been noted to have minimal instructions, requiring the player to experiment and to perceive the forest's ecosystem to determine how to progress, instead of a set of objectives. One example requires the player to observe that one species of bird likes a certain type of flower, suggesting that they may be able to use the bird's song to interact in a different manner than if they used the flower's song. Fe has been favorably compared to Journey and Shadow of the Colossus for this ""hands-off"" approach to gameplay.  "

The game features three modes of play: the world map, the field, and the battle screen.:15,20 At its grandest scale, players explore the entire world of Final Fantasy VII on a 3D world map. The world map is littered with representations of areas for the player to enter, including towns, environments, and ruins. Natural barriers—such as mountains, deserts, and bodies of water—block access by foot to some areas; as the game progresses, the player receives vehicles that help traverse these obstacles.:44 Chocobos can be found in certain spots on the map, and if caught, can be ridden to areas inaccessible by foot or vehicle.:46 In field mode, the player navigates fully scaled versions of the areas represented on the world map. For the first time in the series, this mode is represented in three-dimensional space. The player can explore the environment, talk with characters, advance the story, and initiate event games in this mode.:15 Event games are short minigames that use special control functions and are often tied into the story.:18 While in field mode, the player may also find shops and inns. Shops provide an opportunity to buy and sell items that can aid Cloud and his party, such as weapons, armor, and accessories. If the characters rest at an inn, their hit points and mana points will be restored, along with any abnormalities contracted during battles.:17  At random intervals on the world map and in field mode, and at specific moments in the story, the game will enter the battle screen. This screen places the player characters on one side, the enemies on the other, and employs an ""Active Time Battle"" (ATB) system in which the characters exchange moves until one side is defeated. The damage (or healing) dealt by either side is quantified on screen. Characters have many statistics that determine their effectiveness in battle; for example, hit points determine how much damage they can take, and magic determines how much damage they can inflict with spells. Each character on the screen has a time gauge; when a character's gauge is full, the player can input a command for that character. The commands change as the game progresses, and are dependent on the characters in the player's party and their equipment. Commands may include attacking with a weapon, casting magic, using items, summoning monsters, and other actions that either damage the enemy or aid the player characters. Final Fantasy VII also features powerful, character-specific commands called Limit Breaks, which can be used only after a special gauge is charged by enemy attacks. After being attacked, characters may be afflicted by one or more abnormal ""statuses"", such as poison or paralysis. These statuses and their adverse effects can be removed by special items or abilities. When all the enemies are defeated, the battle ends and the player may be rewarded with money, items, and experience points. If the player is defeated, it is game over and the game must be loaded to the last save point.:20–27  When not in battle, the player can use the menu screen. On this screen, the player can review each character's status and statistics, use items and abilities, change equipment, save the game (when on the world map or at a save point), and manage orbs called Materia. The main method of customizing characters in Final Fantasy VII, Materia may be added to equipment to provide characters with new magic spells, monsters to summon, commands, statistical upgrades, and other benefits. Materia levels up with their own experience point system and can be combined to create different effects.:30–42  "
385,Final Fantasy VIII,/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VIII,Role-playing,Square Enix,Square Enix,"September 3, 2019","September 3, 2019","September 3, 2019"," Like the Final Fantasy games before it, Final Fantasy VIII consists of three main modes of play: the world map, the field map, and the battle screen. The world map is a 3D display in which the player may navigate freely across a small-scale rendering of the game world. Characters travel across the world map in a variety of ways, including by foot, car, Chocobo, train, and airship. The field map consists of controllable 3D characters overlaid on one or more 2D pre-rendered backgrounds, which represent environmental locations such as towns or forests. The battle screen is a 3D model of a location such as a street or room, where turn-based fights between playable characters and CPU-controlled enemies take place. The interface is menu-driven, as in previous titles, but with the typical weapon and armor systems removed and new features present, such as the Junction system. Also featured is a collectible card-based minigame called ""Triple Triad"".  For Final Fantasy VIII, Hiroyuki Ito designed a battle system based on summoned monsters, called ""Guardian Forces"", abbreviated in-game as ""GF"". Assigning (""junctioning"") a GF onto a character allows the player to use battle commands beyond Attack with the main weapon, such as Magic, GF (to have a junctioned GF perform an action), and Item. Previous Final Fantasy titles provided each character with a limited pool of magic points that were consumed by each spell; in Final Fantasy VIII, spells are acquired (""drawn"") either from enemies in battle, Draw Points distributed throughout the environments, or by refining items and cards. Spells are then stocked on characters as quantified inventory (up to 100 per spell and limited to 32 distinct spells per character) and are consumed one by one when used. Characters can also junction (equip) these spells onto their statistics—such as Strength, Vitality, and Luck—for various bonuses, provided the character has junctioned a Guardian Force. The junction system's flexibility affords the player a wide range of customization.  These expanded mechanics for summons were a departure for the series; in previous titles, summons were relegated to a single action during battle. The junction system also acts as a substitute for armor and accessories, which were used in earlier games to modify character statistics. Moreover, where earlier titles required weapons to be equipped and tailored to the character, each major character in Final Fantasy VIII features a unique weapon which can be upgraded, affecting its appearance, power, and Limit Break.  As in Final Fantasy VII, characters in Final Fantasy VIII have unique abilities called ""Limit Breaks"", which range from powerful attacks to support spells. While the characters in Final Fantasy VII receive Limit Breaks after incurring significant damage, in Final Fantasy VIII, Limit Breaks become available only at low health (hit points) under normal circumstances. The magic spell Aura increases the probability of Limit Breaks appearing, regardless of a character's remaining hit points, while various status afflictions can prevent Limit Breaks. They are similar to the Desperation Attacks of Final Fantasy VI, albeit more frequent. Final Fantasy VIII also introduced interactive elements to complement Limit Break animations. These interactive sequences, which vary between character, weapon, and Limit Break, range from randomly selected magic spells to precisely timed button inputs. Successfully completing an interactive sequence increases the potency of the Limit Break.  Final Fantasy VIII features an experience point (EXP) system quite different from previous titles.  The essentials remain unchanged: characters gain EXP after defeating enemies, which are typically encountered randomly throughout the game's environments. Earning a set amount of EXP causes the character to gain a level, which increases their overall statistics. While previous titles feature an EXP curve that increases with each level (e.g. getting to level 2 requires 200 EXP, level 3 requires 400, etc.), characters in Final Fantasy VIII gain a level after accumulating a flat rate of 1000 points.  Enemy levels are based on the party's average level; in most RPGs, enemy levels remain stagnant. Some bosses have level caps to prevent the main quest from becoming too difficult. Higher-level enemies are capable of inflicting and withstanding significantly more damage, may have additional special attacks, and carry additional magic spells, allowing for Junctioning bonuses which themselves far exceed the bonuses imparted by level-gain. The game's unique EXP and level system allows a player to grind to maximum Level 100 before even beginning the plot, though this will result in far more powerful enemies.  In addition to gaining levels, Guardian Forces earn Ability Points (AP) after battles, which are automatically allocated to special abilities that Guardian Forces can learn. When a Guardian Force has learned an ability, that ability becomes available for any character or the character party, as is the case with field abilities. These abilities allow characters to attack more efficiently, refine magic spells from items, receive stat bonuses upon leveling up, access shops remotely, and use additional battle commands.  "
386,Final Fantasy IX,/wiki/Final_Fantasy_IX,Role-playing,Square Enix,Square Enix,"February 14, 2019","February 13, 2019","February 13, 2019"," In Final Fantasy IX, the player navigates a character throughout the game world, exploring areas and interacting with non-player characters. Most of the game occurs on ""field screens"" consisting of pre-rendered backgrounds representing towns and dungeons. To aid exploration on the field screen, Final Fantasy IX introduces the ""field icon"", an exclamation mark appearing over their lead character's head, signalling an item or sign is nearby. Players speak with moogles to record their progress, restore life energy with a tent and purchase items—a deviation from previous installments, which used a save point to perform these functions. Moogles can also be contacted from the world map; with an item called a Moogle flute. Moogles may request the playable character deliver letters to other Moogles via Mognet, playable characters might also receive letters from non-playable characters.  Players journey between field screen locations on the world map, a three dimensional, downsized representation of Final Fantasy IX's world presented from a top-down perspective. Players can freely navigate around the world map screen unless restricted by terrain like bodies of water or mountain ranges. To overcome geographical limitations, players can ride chocobos, sail on a boat or pilot airships. Like previous Final Fantasy installments, travel across the world map screen and hostile field screen locations is interrupted by random enemy encounters.  Final Fantasy IX offers a new approach to town exploration with the introduction of Active Time Events (ATE). These allow the player to view events unfolding at different locations, providing character development, special items and prompts for key story-altering decisions. ATE are occasionally used to simultaneously control two teams when the party is divided to solve puzzles and navigate mazes.  "

The game is played from a fixed camera angle, and similar to other touch screen role playing games, the character can be moved by selecting the location for the character to walk to, rather than with a D-pad control scheme. Additional sidequests unique to the game were added, including treasure hunting and fetch quests. Exploration and combat shifted from a behind the back view to an overhead perspective with simplified controls more suitable for playing on a touchscreen. Music and voice acting was mostly kept intact, while the graphics were given a makeover with ""chibified"" character designs.   The game follows the same plot as the original game, although it eliminates the open world of the original, in addition to many sidequests in favor of a more focused experience.  The game is divided into ten chapters; the first chapter is available for free, with the remaining nine being able to be purchased individually or as a whole with discounted pricing.  "
391,The Final Station,/wiki/The_Final_Station,Action,Do My Best Games,TinyBuild,Unreleased,"February 23, 2018","February 27, 2018"," The Final Station consists of two types of gameplay. The first is the inside of the train part of the game where the player must balance taking care of survivors that they have rescued by feeding them or healing them and taking care of the train by completing small mini games to keep the experimental train running until they reach the next train station destination. The second part of the game is the in game combat this happens at every train station. In the game, the player will explore a side scrolling level with an apocalyptic theme that requires a strategic plan to complete. A player must decide on what resources to use and risk, such as melee combat, shooting an enemy and using their small amount of ammunition, using the environment to deal with enemies or trying to run past and avoid the enemies. There are varying types of enemies, making the levels and strategies needed harder. The player will need to find a hidden code at each station to get the train moving again and also find resources such as ammo, food and survivors.   The player takes the role of a conductor named Edward Jones, who is working as a train operator 106 years after a catastrophe dubbed ""The First Visitation"". One day, the Conductor is tasked with taking an experimental train to pick up a special cargo. However, during the journey, the Conductor quickly discovers that he is in the midst of ""The Second Visitation"", as cities and towns are attacked by an unknown force, and their inhabitants are transformed into aggressive monsters by some unknown infection. Eventually, the Conductor picks up the power source and central processor for the Guardian, a massive war machine being built to protect humanity from the Second Visitation. The Conductor finally reaches the city of Metropole where the Guardian is being built and delivers the cargo.   On the way home, the Conductor picks up a mysterious stranger who rides with him and speaks with him in cryptic clues. He reveals to the Conductor that the infection that is transforming people into monsters is not a virus, but a medicine that was meant to make people stronger, and that the radiation the train's engine is generating is protecting the Conductor from its effects. Shortly after, the train breaks down, forcing the Conductor to make the rest of the journey on foot. Along the way, he passes the destroyed wreck of the Guardian. When he finally reaches his hometown, he discovers that the people who are apparently immune to the infection are already rebuilding society, but he himself is showing symptoms of infection. The Conductor manages to reach his home but succumbs to the infection before he can see his daughter. The mysterious stranger then arrives and promises to look after the Conductor's daughter before mercifully killing him.  "
392,Fire Emblem Three Houses,/wiki/Fire_Emblem_Three_Houses,Tactical role-playing,Intelligent Systems,Nintendo,"July 26, 2019","July 26, 2019","July 26, 2019"," Fire Emblem: Three Houses is a tactical role-playing game in which players control a player character whose gender and name are chosen at the beginning of the game. During the opening hours, the player character is asked to teach at the Garreg Mach Monastery, which acts as a hub for game activities. Choosing a particular house to teach impacts the narrative from that point on. The player's time is divided between story-based battles that advance the main narrative, and periods in Garreg Mach where they interact with students and staff members there. While the opening half of the game focuses on this school system, the story skips ahead five years and focuses more on battle, with the player being locked to the house they chose during the opening half.  During the periods between storyline battles, the player has a set number of days marked on a calendar, which can be used for a variety of activities from teaching classes and field exercises to planting seeds in the greenhouse and fishing in the pond. The player also has free time events, where they can socially interact with students and build up relationships with them. Building a relationship is done through Support actions, with actions and dialogue choices impacting a character's Support level. If the relationship is strong enough, this can lead to the two marrying after a story-based time skip event. By raising particular attributes through actions in battle and within the Monastery, the player can recruit students from other houses, alongside other characters. Each action during academy sections costs a fixed number of time points, with a set number of time points available each day and more activities than can be covered by the points available. The player must choose which events to trigger, losing access to others in consequence.  As with other Fire Emblem games, Three Houses uses a turn-based battle system; players take control of a set number of unique units. They move across a grid, transitioning from a top-down perspective to a third-person view when a battle is triggered. A new feature to the series allows player to hire Battalions, additional troops that can support a chosen unit. Battalions have passive abilities which grant character buffs to the lead unit, and can perform special moves called Gambits, which can range from healing multiple units to stunning powerful enemies. Players can also zoom in on the battlefield to assess individual battalions. As with other entries, there is a ""Classic"" mode where characters who fall in battle are subjected to permanent death, and a ""Casual"" mode where fallen characters are revived after each battle. After a certain point in the story, players can rewind and undo a set amount of turn actions per battle using the ""Divine Pulse"" ability.  Every unit is assigned a character class, which can be customized. While characters have starting abilities which naturally grant them a class, they can be taught additional skills which alter their class. Class changes are available upon a student's ""certification"" during the school segments, with certain prerequisites recommended to have a higher chance at passing the corresponding certification exam. Prior to starting a school week, lesson plans can be put into place to individually manage a unit's growth, build Support between two classmates by engaging them in group assignments, or simply instruct the class automatically with a passive ""auto-instruct"" feature. Rather than the previously-established Weapon Triangle of earlier Fire Emblem games, different units have weapon-based skills called Combat Arts they can be taught during the school segments. Weapons have a set number of uses before they degrade and have their stats reduced. Combat Arts are learned by becoming proficient in a type of weapon. They deal higher damage than standard attacks in exchange for a large chunk of a weapon's durability.  "

Games represented in Warriors include Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light, Fire Emblem Gaiden, Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade, Fire Emblem Awakening, and Fire Emblem Fates. The player defeats enemies with any character, accomplishing specific goals to beat maps. In addition to hack-and-slash combat, the game includes the ability to give tactical commands to units and the Weapon Triangle, which originated from the Fire Emblem series.  Weapons in the game include axes, lances, swords, bows, tomes, and dragonstones. When characters assist, heal, or fight alongside each other in battle, their bond strengthens. Like in Fire Emblem games, if two characters' bond increases enough, a support conversation will be unlocked. The game will also utilize all existing and future Fire Emblem Amiibo figurines, which give weapons related to the character represented by the Amiibo that is used.   While the royal twins of Aytolis, Rowan and Lianna spar with their friend Prince Darios of Gristonne, the kingdom is suddenly attacked by monsters. Outrealm Fiends to be precise. The three are separated from their mother, Aytolis's Queen Yelena during the attack, who gives them the Shield of Flames before being captured. The group learns that Darios' father Oskar is seeking to revive the evil Chaos Dragon Velezark, and that they must power up the Shield of Flames with Gleamstones created from the power of heroes from other worlds to prevent Velezark's resurrection.  Rowan and Lianna travel across Aytolis, rallying support from heroes from Fire Emblem: Awakening, Fire Emblem Fates, and Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light. During an attack on a Gristonne fortress, Velezark successfully possesses Darios, who steals the Shield of Flames just after it is complete. Rowan and Lianna pursue him to Gristonne, where they discover Yelena has been captured to be used as a sacrifice to revive Velezark. Rowan and Lianna successfully rescue their mother, leading to Darios sacrificing Oskar to complete the ritual to revive Velezark. Now freed from the possession, Darios returns the Shield of Flames to the group before falling to his death. Rowan, Lianna, and the other heroes then battle Velezark and finally slay him. With Velezark slain, the other heroes return to their home worlds and Queen Yelena crowns the twins as rulers of Aytolis.  "
394,Firewatch,/wiki/Firewatch,Adventure,Campo Santo,Panic,"December 18, 2018","December 17, 2018","December 17, 2018"," Firewatch is an adventure game played from a first-person view that takes place in the American state of Wyoming in 1989. Players take on the role of Henry, a fire lookout who is assigned to his own tower in Shoshone National Forest. Through exploration of the surrounding area, Henry uncovers clues about mysterious occurrences in the vicinity that are related to the ransacking of his tower while out on a routine patrol and a shadowy figure that occasionally appears watching him from afar. Henry's only means of communication is a walkie-talkie connecting him to his supervisor, Delilah. Players may choose from a number of dialog options to speak with her upon the discovery of new interactive objects or environments, or can refrain from communicating. The player's choices will influence the tone of Henry's relationship with Delilah. As the story progresses, new areas will be opened up for players. The game also features a day-night cycle. Objects found in the wilderness can be kept in the inventory for later use.   After his wife develops early-onset dementia, Henry (Rich Sommer) takes a job as a fire lookout in Shoshone National Forest, Wyoming. On his first day, Delilah (Cissy Jones), a lookout in another watchtower, contacts him via walkie-talkie and asks him to investigate illegal fireworks by the lake. Henry discovers a pair of teenage girls, who accuse him of leering. On his way home he comes across a locked cave, and spots a shadowy figure watching him before disappearing. He returns to his watchtower to find it ransacked. The next day, Delilah asks Henry to investigate a downed communication line. He finds it cut, with a note apparently signed by the teens. He and Delilah plot to scare the girls off, but when he finds the girls' campsite ransacked and abandoned, they begin to worry.  Henry finds an old backpack and a disposable camera belonging to a boy named Brian Goodwin, who Delilah explains was the son of Ned, a former lookout. Ned was an outdoorsman who drank heavily due to his traumatic experiences in the Vietnam War, while his son, Brian, enjoyed fantasy novels and role-playing games. Though it is against the rules for employees to bring their children to the towers, Delilah was fond of Brian and lied about his presence. He and Ned apparently left abruptly and never returned. The teenage girls are reported missing. Fearing an inquiry, Delilah falsifies reports to say that neither she nor Henry encountered the girls.  Two months after Henry started his job, a small wildfire breaks out south of his tower. Two weeks later, Henry discovers a radio and a clipboard while fishing, with notes including transcripts of his conversations with Delilah. He is knocked unconscious by an unseen assailant and wakes up to find the clipboard and radio gone. In a meadow referred to on the clipboard letterhead, he finds a fenced-off government research area. He breaks in and discovers surveillance equipment and typewritten reports detailing his and Delilah's conversations and private lives. He also discovers a tracking device which he takes with him. Henry and Delilah discuss destroying the government camp, but decide against it. As Henry hikes home, however, someone sets fire to the camp.  The next day, Henry uses the tracking device to find a backpack with a key to the locked cave. Delilah reports a figure in Henry's tower; when Henry arrives, he finds a Walkman taped to the door with an incriminating recording of Henry and Delilah's discussion about destroying the government camp. The next day, someone impersonating Henry calls another lookout and claims that Delilah knows the cause of the station fire, putting her and Henry more on edge.  Henry uses the found key to enter the cave but is suddenly locked inside by an unseen figure. Deep in the cave, he discovers Brian's body before escaping the cave. Delilah is upset by the news. The next day, an evacuation order is given for all the lookouts, as the wildfire that Henry had spotted and named earlier has grown out of control.  As Henry prepares to leave, the tracking device begins beeping. He follows the signal and discovers a tape from Ned. Ned claims that Brian's death was accidental, and that the boy fell due to climbing inexperience. Unwilling to return to society after Brian's death, Ned secretly lived in the area ever since. Choosing to venture deeper into the wilderness, Ned warns Henry not to look for him. Henry finds Ned's makeshift bunker, along with items stolen from the government camp, the lookout towers, and the teenage girls, who Delilah confirms have been found safe. The government camp was simply studying wildlife; Ned had been using its radio equipment to ensure no one was looking for him and to create transcripts to scare Henry away. Despite Ned’s confession, Delilah blames him for Brian's death and leaves on the helicopter. Henry goes to her tower, and he and Delilah say their goodbyes via radio before Henry evacuates.  "

396,Five Nights at Freddy's,/wiki/Five_Nights_at_Freddy%27s_(video_game),Simulation,Clickteam,Clickteam,Unreleased,"November 29, 2019","November 29, 2019"," Five Nights at Freddy's is a survival horror video game with point-and-click elements. Players act as a security guard at the restaurant Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where they must survive their shift that lasts from midnight to 6:00 a.m. (approximately 8 minutes and 36 seconds of real time, 4 minutes and 30 seconds on the mobile and tablet editions) without being jumpscared by the five animatronic animals that inhabit the facility, Freddy the Bear, Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken, Foxy the Fox and Golden Freddy.   The player sits alone in an office and is given access to a network of security cameras throughout the facility to track the movement of the animatronics. Each animatronic character roams the restaurant and has distinct movement patterns, and most of the characters' movements take place off-screen. The camera feeds are barely lit and distorted; and the kitchen only contains an audio feed. The cameras do not cover certain areas of the building, most notably the two hallways directly to the left and right of the player. The player cannot leave the office, but can close doors for self-defense and briefly turn on the lights in the hallways to check for animatronics. Use of these actions consume the player's limited electrical power; if all the power is exhausted, the cameras become inoperable, the doors open and the lights go out. Once these things happen, Freddy will appear in the left doorway with flashing lights in his eyes while a music box rendition of ""Toreador March"" plays. After a random amount of time, the office will go pitch black and Freddy will jumpscare the player, resulting in a game over, unless the player makes it to 6 a.m. before this occurs. If the player is jumpscared by any of the animatronics, they must restart from the beginning of the night.   The game has five levels comprising five ""nights"" in the game (hence the game's title), each increasing in difficulty. Completion of the main game awards the player a star in the main menu and unlocks an even more difficult 6th ""night"", and completion of this level awards another star and opens up a ""Custom Night"" during which the player can adjust the AI difficulty of each individual character except for Golden Freddy. Completion of the game's most difficult challenge in which all robots are set to the highest level of 20 (often referred to as 20/20/20/20 mode or 4/20 mode) awards the player a third star.   The main character, Mike Schmidt, has started a job working as a night guard at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a restaurant owned by the fictional ""Fazbear Entertainment"".  Mike's predecessor leaves a voicemail message each night and explains different aspects of the history of the restaurant. He explains that the restaurant's four animatronic characters – Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken and Foxy the Pirate Fox  – come to life at night because their servomotors will lock up if they are left off for too long. The employee warns Mike that if one of the animatronics encounters a human after hours, it will automatically assume that the human is an endoskeleton without its costume and that the animatronic will ""forcefully stuff"" the person into a spare mechanical Freddy Fazbear costume, killing the person in the process.  Throughout the game, newspaper clippings and stories from the phone caller imply that the restaurant's image and standing with the general public suffered dramatically over time. The man on the phone mentions an incident called ""The Bite of '87"", which involved an animatronic going haywire and biting off a victim's frontal lobe. Newspaper clippings in the restaurant's east hallway corner reveal that a reported mass murder occurred on site, which supposedly occurred when a mysterious man, later revealed to be William Afton, wearing a suit based off of one of the characters lured five children into a back room before killing them. Later, the restaurant received complaints that the animatronics began to emit foul odors while blood and mucus leaked from their eyes and mouths, with one customer comparing them to ""reanimated carcasses"", implying that the children's dead bodies were stuffed inside the animatronics and the children's ghosts are possessing them. Alongside it, a secret fifth animatronic called Golden Freddy appears as an easter egg, having the power to outright close the game. Alongside that, there are hallucinations saying ""IT'S ME"" showing up randomly, as an easter egg.  At the start of the fourth night, the phone guy is presumed to have been killed by one of the animatronics. On the fifth night, Mike receives a phone call with a garbling sound on the other end, implied to be one of the animatronics. Once Mike survives the first five nights, he will receive a paycheck. Completing the fifth night will award the player a star on the title screen and unlock an even harder sixth night. Completing the sixth night will result in Mike earning another paycheck and once again, reward the player with a star on the title screen and a customizable seventh night called Custom Night. In this night, players can customize the four animatronic's AI from 0 to 20. The higher the number of A.I., the more difficult the animatronic becomes. After the seventh night, Mike is fired for tampering with the animatronics, unprofessionalism, and bad odor. If the players manages to beat the seventh night with all the animatronics set to 20 (commonly referred to as 4/20 mode) that will be awarded the third and final star on the title screen.    "
397,Five Nights at Freddy's 2,/wiki/Five_Nights_at_Freddy%27s_2,Simulation,Clickteam,Clickteam,Unreleased,"November 29, 2019","November 29, 2019"," Similar to the first game, Five Nights at Freddy's 2 is a survival horror video game with point-and-click elements. Players must survive a night shift at the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza restaurant (a pastiche of Chuck E. Cheese's and ShowBiz Pizza Place) from 12 A.M. to 6 A.M. game time (approximately seven minutes and six seconds), without being attacked by any of the animatronic enemy characters that wander from room to room. There are multiple different animatronic characters: the original game's antagonists: Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunnie, Chica the Chicken, Foxy the Pirate, and Golden Freddy, as well as toy versions of Freddy, Bonnie, Chica and Foxy (referred to as ""Mangle""), the Marionette (often referred to as ""The Puppet""), and a humanoid robot named ""Balloon Boy"".  Much like the first game, the player cannot leave the office but can track the animatronics' movements via a network of security cameras placed throughout the building. The office has three entrances (a hallway and two side air vents); in a departure from the previous game, none of these can be sealed off to prevent enemies from entering. Each vent is equipped with a light that can be used to check for any characters that are about to crawl into the office. Players are given a wearable Freddy Fazbear masks to ward off approaching animatronics; however, this strategy will not work on certain characters, who must be repelled by other means. A flashlight is also available, used to check the hallway and darkened areas of the camera feeds, as well as to reset Foxy via strobing. Unlike the previous title, the power supply for the cameras and vent lights is unlimited, but the flashlight has a limited battery life; if it runs out, the player becomes vulnerable to attack. In addition, a music box has been placed in one room and must be remotely wound up through the camera interface, to avoid being attacked by the Marionette, who appears when the music stops. Failure to defend oneself from the animatronics will result in a jumpscare.  Unlike the first game, after the player is killed, there is a chance that, rather than the Game Over screen, one of four 8-bit minigames will appear with instructions given at the start of each. These minigames contain insight into the plot of the game.  The game consists of five levels referred to as ""nights"", increasing in difficulty. Completing all five adds a star to the title screen and unlocks an even more difficult sixth night, which in turn adds a second star and unlocks a ""Custom Night"" upon completing the night. In the Custom Night, the player can adjust the AI difficulty of the individual animatronics (0 to 20) or play one of ten pre-set challenges. Completing Custom Night with every animatronic set to 20 results in adding the final star to the title screen.   The player character, whose name is later revealed to be Jeremy Fitzgerald, has started working as a night watch security guard at the improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. As he did in the previous game, a certain Freddy Fazbear's Pizza employee calls Jeremy on the phone in the office at the beginning of each night to explain both gameplay and parts of the backstory surrounding the restaurant. He explains that the new animatronics (consisting of Toy Freddy, Toy Bonnie, Toy Chica, Mangle, Balloon Boy, and the Puppet), which have special facial recognition software and access to a criminal database in order to protect the children from potential harm, were not programmed with a proper night mode; when things go silent, their programming tells them that they are in the wrong room and they seek out the nearest source of noise to find people to entertain, which happens to be the office.  As in the previous game, the animatronics' programming tells them that there should not be people in the restaurant after hours, so when they encounter Jeremy, they believe he is an animatronic endoskeleton without a costume and will attempt to stuff him into a spare Freddy Fazbear suit, killing him in the process. The employee explains that this restaurant has an unlimited power source at night, unlike the previous location, but there are no doors blocking access to the office, requiring the player to use a spare Freddy Fazbear head to trick most of the animatronics into thinking he is not an endoskeleton; he gives additional tips to help the player survive their shift. As more enemy characters appear as the game progresses, the employee informs Jeremy of their presence, their movement patterns, and some background information on their presence in the game. For example, he explains that the older animatronics (from an older location; and are later refurbished into the animatronics from the first game) are in the new restaurant, and have been retrofitted with the new technology, but as the company opted to redesign the characters, they are kept for spare parts.  As the game progresses, it is hinted that something is going on during the day, as the man on the phone mentions that rumors are going around and, later, that a police investigation is going on regarding the restaurant. Atari-styled minigames reveal that the restaurant has had a troubled past, as it was the location of a mass murder in which at least five children were murdered, with the culprit frequently appearing as a nameless purple figure (though later installments would give him the name William Afton). On the game's fifth night, Jeremy is informed by the employee that the restaurant has been put on lockdown due to an unspecified event, but which is in place to make sure no employees, present or former, can enter or leave. The man also mentions that the position of the restaurant's day shift security has a vacancy and Jeremy may be promoted to it, and that the owner of Fredbear's Family Diner (a restaurant preceding Freddy Fazbear's Pizza) will be contacted for more information on the incident. Notably, the check the player receives at the end of Night 5 is dated 1987, thereby establishing the game as a prequel to the original.  On the sixth night, the man on the phone informs Jeremy that the restaurant has been shut down for undisclosed reasons, although he mentions the use of a ""spare yellow suit"" and an issue of the animatronics not functioning properly. He also says that he will be taking over as night-shift security guard when the restaurant reopens. If Jeremy is successful in surviving the sixth night, he is promoted to day shift to cover a birthday party the next day to make sure the animatronics do not cause any problems. A newspaper that is shown in the winning screen of the sixth night says that the restaurant will close down and the new animatronics will be scrapped; however, the older ones will be saved for when the restaurant reopens, hinting at the events of the first game.  On the Custom Night of this installment, the player acts as a new character named Fritz Smith due to Jeremy being moved on the day shift. Upon completing Custom Night, Fritz is fired for tampering with the animatronics and odor, a callback to the first game's Custom Night completion screen.   Between Night 6 and the Custom Night, there is a high chance that The Bite of '87 was caused. The Bite of '87 was an event mentioned by the man on the phone in the first game, in which an animatronic attacked a human, ending with the human surviving, but ending up without a frontal lobe. It is highly likely that the victim was Jeremy Fitzgerald, after being moved on the day shift. The animatronic that attacked him was most likely Mangle, as it has sharp teeth, and due to the fact that the newer models were scrapped, it had to be one of them.  "
398,Five Nights at Freddy's 3,/wiki/Five_Nights_at_Freddy%27s_3,Simulation,Clickteam,Clickteam,Unreleased,"November 29, 2019","November 29, 2019"," The gameplay deviates from the previous games in the series slightly. In keeping with the first two installments, players are once again tasked with surviving a week of night shifts, lasting from 12 A.M. to 6 A.M. (4 minutes of real time). However, this game features only one animatronic that can physically attack the player. Several animatronics from earlier games return as ""phantoms"" that cannot harm the player directly, but can hinder efforts to survive until 6 A.M.  The game takes place in a horror-themed attraction named Fazbear's Fright, which is constructed using props and equipment salvaged from the former Fazbear Entertainment restaurants. The attraction aims to capitalize on the previous incidents that occurred at the various restaurants formerly operated by the company. The player must monitor two separate security camera systems, one each for the rooms/corridors and ventilation ductwork in order to track the animatronic's movements. In addition, the player must watch the status of three operating systems and reboot them whenever they malfunction. These systems control the cameras, a set of audio devices that can be used to lure the animatronic away from the player's position, and the ventilation. Failure to keep the latter of these running can cause the player to hallucinate seeing multiple animatronics in the building. If the real animatronic enters the office, it jumpscares the player and the game ends.  The game consists of five nights, increasing in difficulty, and completing all five unlocks an even more challenging ""Nightmare"" night. Several low-resolution minigames are hidden within the main game; completing all of them unlocks the game's ""good ending"" and grants access to bonus content that includes a cheat menu.  If the player completes the ""Nightmare"" night, they will unlock the cheat menu. The cheat menu offers a range of options, including a mode to make the animatronics act more aggressive and therefore make the game harder, depending on the player's skills. Other cheats include a radar and the ability to make nights faster.   Set thirty years after the events of the first game, the player assumes the role of a newly-hired employee at Fazbear's Fright, a horror-themed attraction based on the unsolved mysteries of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, constructed using paraphernalia salvaged from the original restaurants. During the week before the attraction is scheduled to open to the public, the player must watch over the facility from the security office during their shift (12:00 A.M. to 6:00 A.M. game time), using a network of surveillance cameras placed in the rooms and air vents. In addition, the player must monitor the status of three operating systems – cameras, audio and ventilation – and reboot them whenever they begin to malfunction. Camera problems cause the video feeds, already poorly lit and distorted, to become totally obscured by static. If the ventilation fails, the player's vision begins to black out. The player may also see phantoms of animatronics from the previous games; these can cause system malfunctions, most commonly in the ventilation, but cannot directly harm the player.  After the first night, the staff at Fazbear's Fright uncover an older deteriorated, rabbit-like animatronic which they nickname ""Springtrap""; The player must now prevent it from entering the office and attacking; if this occurs, the game ends. The player can seal off the air vents at certain points to block its progress, but cannot seal the door or air vent that lead directly into the office. The audio system, when functioning properly, can be used to play sound effects that draw Springtrap away from the office. Ventilation malfunctions can cause the player to hallucinate seeing more than one animatronic on the cameras.  As the nights progress, the player hears a series of instructional cassette tapes (similar to the telephone calls from the first two games) that instruct employees how to operate two suits which can function as both an animatronic and a costume for humans. The tapes also discuss a ""safe room,"" an additional emergency room which ""is not included in the digital map layout programmed in the animatronics or the security cameras, is hidden to customers, invisible to animatronics, and is always off-camera.""  However, later nights discourage use of the suits. The Night 4 recording states the suits are ""deemed temporarily unfit for employees"" following ""an unfortunate incident at the sister location involving multiple and simultaneous spring lock failures."" To replace the faulty suits, the archive states that temporary costumes that ""were found on very short notice"" would be provided, though requesting that ""questions about appropriateness/relevance should be deflected.""  The recording which plays during Night 5 reminds employees that the safe room is ""a safety location for employees only"" and that customers must never be taken there. Also, after discovering that one of the special suits was ""noticeably moved,"" it reminds employees that the suits are ""not safe to wear under any circumstances.""  Low-resolution minigames between nights hint at the restaurant's troubled past, with the first four nights' minigames depicting the original animatronics following a dark purple animatronic before being violently disassembled by William Afton, previously seen in the minigames of Five Nights at Freddy's 2 as the man responsible for the various murders that occurred throughout the fictional franchise's history. In the fifth night's minigame, the ghosts of the five children who inhabited the animatronics corner William Afton, who attempts to protect himself by hiding in the ""Spring Bonnie"" suit. However, the suit's faulty spring-lock mechanism fails, and the man is crushed as the children fade away, leaving their killer to seemingly bleed to death, explaining Springtrap's origins.  Unlike the previous entries, Five Nights at Freddy's 3 contains two endings, depending on whether the player has found and completed all of the hidden minigames within the main game. Some of these are only available on specific nights, while others can be accessed during any night. The ""bad ending"" is attained from completing the game without completing all the hidden minigames, and shows a screen depicting the heads of the five animatronics from the first game with lit-up eyes, implying that the animatronics are still possessed. Completing all the hidden minigames before completing the game earns the ""good ending"", which is the same screen as described previously but with the animatronics' heads turned off, with one head disappearing, presumably Golden Freddy. This implies that the children's souls have finally been put to rest.  Completing all five nights unlocks a bonus night, ""Nightmare"", which boosts the game's difficulty, similar to ""Night 6"" in the previous titles. While playing the mode, an archived recording states that all Freddy Fazbear's Pizza locations' safe rooms will be permanently sealed, instructing employees that they are ""not  be mentioned to family, friends or insurance representatives."" When this night is completed, a newspaper clipping reveals that Fazbear's Fright was destroyed in a fire shortly after the events of the game and that any salvageable items from the attraction are to be auctioned off. However, brightening the image reveals Springtrap in the background, confirming that he survived and is set to return in one of the next games.  "
399,Five Nights at Freddy's 4,/wiki/Five_Nights_at_Freddy%27s_4,Simulation,Clickteam,Clickteam,Unreleased,"November 29, 2019","November 29, 2019"," Unlike previous Five Nights at Freddy's games, the game is not set in a security office, but in a child's bedroom. There are no security cameras and instead of ""Phone Guy"", the player is given on-screen instructions to help the player during the game. The player is equipped with a flashlight, similar to the second game, although the light has unlimited power. It can be used to ward away any animatronics seen down the hallway; however, if the player hears either Nightmare Bonnie's or Nightmare Chica's breathing at the door or they see Nightmare Fredbear or Nightmare upon turning on the flashlight, they must immediately close the door. Despite this, the door will eventually open ajar as the player walks away. The player must also monitor the closet to avoid getting attacked by Nightmare Foxy by closing it if necessary, similar to the first game, as well as shooing three miniature animatronics nicknamed 'Freddles' by the FNAF community off the bed before they, once all three are together, summon Nightmare Freddy to attack the player. If the player is not careful in shining the light towards the hallways or leaves the doors, closet and bed unattended for too long, the player will be jumpscared, leading to a game over.  After beating each night, the player may play a timed minigame titled ""Fun with Plushtrap"" (In Halloween update, Plushtrap is replaced by Nightmare Balloon Boy) in which a plush edition of Springtrap, the central animatronic in Five Nights at Freddy's 3, must be lured to the top of an ""X"" marked on the ground within a specific amount of time. If the player succeeds, the player will start the next night at 2:00 A.M. (1:00 A.M. in challenge modes) Like the nightmare animatronics, this timed minigame becomes more challenging as the game progresses. The time bonus does not apply to the unlockable modes. Additionally, if the player gets a game over, the bonus is no longer valid for further plays of the same level.  Like previous games, the game's main storyline takes place over five increasingly-difficult nights with unlockable extra levels. The first four nights will put the player against four animatronics: Nightmare Freddy, Nightmare Bonnie, Nightmare Chica and Nightmare Foxy (Nightmare Mangle in Halloween update). Nightmare Fredbear, who combines the scare tactics of the previous four, is the sole attacker on the fifth night. Completing all five nights will unlock an additional sixth night, where the four animatronics will haunt the player until Nightmare Fredbear takes over when the clock hits 4 AM. Completing the sixth night will unlock the ""Nightmare"" night, where the animatronics are very persistent and Nightmare Fredbear is replaced by the highly aggressive Nightmare, who has a unique game over screen compared to other animatronics. A secret code will unlock an eighth night or called as 20/20/20/20 mode based on the Custom Night modes from the first two games, which sets the A.I. of the animatronics to maximum difficulty. Other unlockables include galleries of the various animatronics and jumpscares, as well as behind-the-scenes looks at the 3D-modelling process for Fredbear and Foxy.  As in most of the previous entries of the series, the story of the game is revealed in interactive Atari-style minigame sections between nights. Each of the minigames are set in a time frame corresponding to the five nights, beginning with ""5 days until the party"", up to ""0 days until the party.""   The game starts with a minigame which shows a boy who is locked in his bedroom with plush toys, which he calls his only friends. After the player survives the first night, the boy's Fredbear plush tells him that ""he"" (the boy's older brother) is hiding in the house, before the boy is jumpscared by him, who is wearing a Foxy mask. After the second night, the boy is abandoned at the pizzeria (implied to be the Fredbear's Family Diner briefly mentioned in the second game), only to be warned by Fredbear's voice that ""he"" is coming and that he must be brave; however, since the boy is afraid of the animatronics and costumed mascots, he ends up bawling. An easter egg during this scene briefly shows William Afton from the second and third games fitting someone into the Spring Bonnie suit.  After the third night, the minigame reveals that other children tease the boy, calling him a coward and crybaby, and that there are rumors of the animatronics coming to life at night and attempting to murder people.  The boy sees his plush toys as his only friends and generally eschews interaction with other people in favor of them. Another easter egg in this minigame establishes the time period, via a commercial or TV show named ""Fredbear and Friends"" dated 1983. After the fourth night, it is revealed that the boy was once locked in the building's parts and services room as a prank. If the fifth night is completed, the boy is shown crying at his birthday party in the pizzeria, with his brother (alongside other bullies) wearing the masks of the animatronics to terrorize the boy. The bullies, deciding to prank the boy, grab him and try to get him close to the Fredbear animatronic's mouth for a ""kiss,"" and end up stuffing the boy's head into the animatronic's mouth. Suddenly, Fredbear, who was in the middle of singing, forcefully closes his mouth, and crushes the boy's head while his brother and his friends stare in sheer horror, realizing their mistake.  After the sixth night, the boy hears his older brother apologizing to him as Fredbear promises him that no matter how many times he ""breaks,"" he and the others will always be there to ""put him back together"" and will always be his friends. The characters then fade out one by one, and the faint sound of a heart monitor flatlining can be heard, death of the boy and ending the minigames. Following this, the player unlocks Nightmare mode, which is the same as the sixth night with the exception of a new animatronic, Nightmare, a more aggressive version of Nightmare Fredbear.         There is a divide in the FNaF community about who had the nightmares. Some say it’s the bite victim, as he’s scared of the animatronics and you play as him during the minigames, while others say it’s the older brother because after seeing his brother get killed, he got nightmares because of Posttraumatic stress disorder.   If the player completes Nightmare mode, an image of a locked metal trunk is displayed; if the player wiggles the padlocks, the game states that ""Perhaps some things are best left forgotten, for now."" Cawthon remained cryptic about what is inside the trunk, and eventually announced that he would not disclose what was in it. He gave only one clue: ""What's in the box? It's the pieces  put together.""  Throughout the game, if the screen is brightened or the player looks closely enough, the progression of the fate of the child can be seen through objects next to the bed. When the player turns to the bed, looking to the left of the Freddy plush, three objects appear at different points in time: a bottle of pills, an IV drip, and a vase of flowers.  "
401,Five Nights at Freddy's Sister Location,/wiki/Five_Nights_at_Freddy%27s_Sister_Location,Simulation,Clickteam,Clickteam,Unreleased,"June 18, 2020",Unreleased," An interviewer is questioning William Afton, the creator of the game's animatronic characters as well as the main antagonist of the overall series, on certain design choices he has made when building the animatronics. William lists several features of Circus Baby, such as her ability to make ice cream, inflate balloons at her fingertips, and take song requests and dance to them. The interviewer is unsatisfied with this answer, as the features William mentioned were not what he was referring to.  Some time later, William Afton's son, Michael Afton is a new employee of Circus Baby's Entertainment and Rental, an underground facility and sister location to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, featuring animatronics that are rented out to children's birthday parties; these animatronics include new circus-themed variations of Freddy (who, unlike the other versions, is not the lead singer), Bonnie (who appears as a hand puppet on Freddy), and Foxy (who takes the role of the ringmaster) as well as several new characters (consisting of Ballora, the Bidybabs, and the Minireenas), including Circus Baby herself. These animatronics originated from another location named ""Circus Baby's Pizza World"", which had been shut down shortly before it was supposed to open due to ""gas leaks"". As his first night starts, HandUnit (an A.I. who assists Michael) assigns him his daily tasks and explains Circus Baby's was formed in response to the success and eventual closure of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. On Night 2, the power goes out and the player must cross through Ballora's room in order to access and reset the facility's circuit breakers. Circus Baby warns Michael to ignore the instructions given by HandUnit in order to avoid being killed by Ballora.  In one of the minigames (after it is completed), Circus Baby extends a claw from her stomach and pulls a little girl (presumed to be William Afton's daughter and Michael's sister, Elizabeth Afton) inside her. It is implied that the girl died inside Baby and that she is now possessed by the girl's soul.  On Night 3, Michael starts by checking to see if the new ""Funtime"" Foxy is on her stage before crawling through her room. The player then has to repair the new versions of Freddy and Bonnie.   Though Michael succeeds in his task, he is captured by Baby and wakes trapped in an animatronic suit on Night 4. He has been placed in an area known as the Scooping Room containing a machine called the Scooper, which can tear endoskeletons out of animatronics. Baby explains to Michael that she kidnapped him. After witnessing Ballora's endoskeleton being torn out by the Scooper, Michael is left to survive the night against the Minireenas while stopping the suit from malfunctioning. On Night 5, two employees are found hanged, and Michael is instructed by Baby to destroy her body by sending it to the Scooping Room. However, it is soon discovered that Baby, along with the other animatronics, have combined themselves into a single body known as Ennard, and wish to use Michael's body as a disguise to escape the facility.   Two endings are possible. In the ""Real Ending,"" Michael follows Baby's instructions and enters the Scooping Room, whereupon the Scooper eviscerates and kills him; Ennard then disguises itself in his skin and escapes. An alternate ""Fake Ending"" requires the player to retrieve a keycard by completing the death minigame and then follow a different route from that described by Baby on Night 5. Doing so will bring Michael to a small room in which he must fend off Ennard until 6:00 AM, in a manner similar to the original Five Nights at Freddy's. Ennard is upset that Michael disobeyed its instructions and will escape and follow him home if he survives the night.  The Custom Night update includes additional cutscenes following on from the Real Ending; Michael's body gradually decomposes, forcing Ennard to abandon it and enter the sewers. After that, he is left on the ground, presumably dead, but is soon mysteriously reanimated. He then talks to his father about his time in the facility (noting that he found and freed ""her"", or Elizabeth, the little girl who is believed to be the soul possessing the Circus Baby animatronic), before setting out to find him. As this happens, the camera pans over to the burned-out ruins of Fazbear's Fright, from which William Afton (who is still possessing Springtrap) emerges.   The bulk of the gameplay in Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location does away with the survival aspect of previous games. Instead of remaining in one place and preventing the animatronic antagonists from attacking, the player must move from room to room in order to fulfill a series of objectives that change during each of the five nights. For example, Night 2 requires the player to sneak across Ballora Gallery and reset a group of circuit breakers, while for Night 4, the player is placed inside a spring lock suit while having to fight off Minireenas.  As in Five Nights at Freddy's 2, when a game ends, the player may be given a chance to play an 8-bit mini game, in which Circus Baby must give cupcakes to children and then bring an ice cream cone to a little girl, who gets killed as shown in the minigame. Completing this mini game grants access to a secret level during Night 5, a near-recreation of the gameplay in the original Five Nights at Freddy's. Here, the player remains in a security office and must prevent a hybrid animatronic called ""Ennard"" from entering it by watching surveillance cameras and closing electric doors, all of which consume a limited power supply.  Clearing all five nights unlocks a gallery of extra features: pictures and blueprints of the game's animatronics, their making-of, a map of the facility, and automatic access to Circus Baby's cupcake mini game. As of the December 1, 2016 update, clearing all nights also unlocks the non-canon Custom Night mode, which is set in a modified version of the Night 5 secret room. The player can choose from several modes and difficulty settings, facing new animatronics, and must conserve both power and oxygen supplies in order to survive. Completing these modes allows the player to view a series of cutscenes that have been declared as part of the series canon; all except the last scene are in 8-bit resolution.  An achievement system exists in the form of four stars, obtained by unlocking both of the game's endings, completing the Circus Baby mini game, and completing the hardest difficulty on each custom night preset.  Like in all Five Nights at Freddy's games, failure to defend oneself from the hostile animatronic characters will result in a jump scare.  "

Scout uses a raft to traverse a large river, the result of an apocalyptic flood which has turned the land into a series of islands. The player must pay attention to Scout's needs such as her energy, thirst, hunger, and warmth, and not paying attention to them can result in death. Like other roguelikes, death is permanent, although the player can restart at predetermined checkpoints along the river if they are playing in Campaign mode. There is a crafting system allowing the player to create new items. Players will need to scavenge areas for valuable items. Factors such as the weather impact the gameplay.

403,Flashback,/wiki/Flashback_(1992_video_game),Action-adventure,Paul Cuisset,Microids,"August 9, 2018","June 7, 2018","June 19, 2018"," As a cinematic platformer, Flashback features gameplay similar to that of 1989's Prince of Persia, and Delphine's own Another World released in 1991. Each level spans a large number of non-scrolling screens, nearly all of which feature multiple levels of altitude – requiring the player character Conrad to jump, grab onto ledges, climb, use elevators, and drop onto lower levels. Conrad exhibits realistic human running speed and jumping ability, as well as realistic weakness – he will die if he falls from too great a height.  Conrad also carries a pistol with unlimited ammunition; a force shield, which absorbs a certain number of shots before needing recharging, acting as Conrad's health (how many attacks he can survive before dying); and a portable force field with unlimited use, which can act as a temporary barrier to block enemies' shots.   As Conrad progresses through the game's seven levels, he is increasingly presented with spatial puzzles, requiring the player to discover how to guide him toward his destination. Late in the game, Conrad receives a teleportation device, and is able to progress by throwing the device and teleporting into otherwise unreachable areas.  In the year 2142, amnesiac Conrad B. Hart is chased by mutants and crash-lands his hover bike in a jungle on Titan. He finds a holocube which fell from his pocket. It contains a recorded message from himself, telling him to meet his friend Ian in New Washington. He makes his way through the jungle and purchases an anti-gravity belt in order to enter New Washington via chasm.  He finds Ian being attacked by police. After he kills them, Ian uses a regenerator to restore Conrad's memories: For his ""end of year thesis"" he had built glasses which measure molecular density and inadvertently discovered that shapeshifting aliens called Morphs, distinguished by their high density, had mixed into the human population. The Morphs realized he was investigating and targeted him. Anticipating memory erasure, he recorded the holocube, and sent a copy of his memory to Ian. Conrad is determined to return to Earth. Ian tells him that the only way he can afford a ticket to Earth is to win one in Death Tower, a game show in which contestants fight to the death, and false papers are required for a pass. To pay for the forged papers, Conrad takes a series of dangerous jobs in the city. He finds himself continually targeted by police, who have presumably been misled by Morph infiltrators.  Conrad wins Death Tower, and travels to Earth. His false papers get him past the checkpoint, but the Morphs soon realize who he is and Conrad is pursued by more cops. He takes a taxi to the Paradise Club, which conceals the Morphs' hideout. He spies on three Morphs through a ceiling vent. They discuss their plan to conquer Earth within hours. Conrad falls through the vent and is taken to a prison cell. Soon, Morphs enter his cell to kill him. Conrad runs past them and picks up a discarded alien gun. Exploring the facility, he discovers a teleporter, and uses it to transport himself to the Morphs' home planet.  He finds a human prisoner named Phillip Howard Clark. As he opens his prison, a Morph appears and executes Phillip. Dying, Phillip gives Conrad an atomic charge. Phillip's diary reveals he had planned to destroy the ""Master Brain"" that controls the aliens, located at the planet's core, but the ""Auxiliary Brain"" must be destroyed to open up the communication pathways to the Master Brain. Conrad destroys the Auxiliary Brain and finds the Master Brain's pathway. As he arrives at a certain spot, he hears Phillip's voice, telling him that the atomic charge should be placed on a loose platform. After he does so, he throws a switch, awakening the brain to cause a tremor, which drops the charge towards the core. Conrad escapes to the hangar and takes a Morph's spacecraft out of the planet's atmosphere before it detonates. As he cannot navigate home due to the Morphs' galaxy not being on any human star charts, he instead puts himself in suspended animation while his ship drifts into space, leading up to the events of Fade to Black.

Captain Flinthook, the player-character, also has a plasma gun and the ability to slow time. The hook is used on environmental elements as well as enemies. For example, some enemies are invulnerable until the player removes their armor via the hook. The player uses the left analog stick to both control the player and aim the hook. The hook is activated via the controller's trigger, and face buttons make the character jump, shoot, throw bombs and interact with nearby objects.

412,Fortnite Battle Royale,/wiki/Fortnite_Battle_Royale,Battle royale,Epic Games,Epic Games,"June 13, 2018","June 11, 2018","June 12, 2018"," The main gameplay for Fortnite Battle Royale follows the standard format for the battle royale genre. The game normally is played either with each player on their own, or in a squad of two to four players, with up to 100 players participating each round. The round starts with players, weaponless, skydiving from floating buses (""Battle Bus"") then deploying a glider onto a region of land. The island's fixed layout includes several landmarks and locations (named in an alliterative fashion, such as ""Lazy Lake"", ""Pleasant Park"", and ""Retail Row"") that are mostly ghost towns, while a random distribution of weapons, shields, and other combat support features can be found by searching buildings and other sites. The goal is to be the last player or team alive by eliminating or avoiding other players. When playing in solo modes, players are immediately eliminated when they exhaust their health, while in squad modes, downed players can crawl around while bleeding out; they can be eliminated immediately by an opponent or revived by a squadmate to help them up. Initially, when the game launched, eliminated players were out of the match, but starting with updates in April 2019, squadmates can attempt to revive a downed player at various ""Reboot vans"" scattered around the map, which are few and far between and in the open, making it a risk to respawn a squadmate. Over time, the game's safe zone (representing the eye of a storm), decreases in size, and players caught outside the zone will take damage. This directs the surviving players into tighter spaces, forcing player encounters. Supply drops will spawn in random locations during a match, providing random weapons and items. Like in the original Fortnite game, Fortnite Battle Royale is primarily played in a third-person perspective.  Fortnite Battle Royale's primary distinction from other battle royale games is the building system, which originated from the original Fortnite survival game. Nearly all objects in the environment can be destroyed and harvested for materials (wood, stone, and metal), which can then be used to build fortifications of limited durabilities, such as walls, ramps, floors, and roofs, which can be used to help traverse the map, protect the player from gunfire, or slow down progression of other players.  Weaker pieces can be destroyed in a few hits, but can be built quickly, while stronger pieces can withstand more punishment, but take longer to build.  The game is free-to-play, supported by microtransactions that allow players to buy ""Vinderbucks"", ""V-Bucks"" for short, the game's internal currency. V-Bucks are also shared with the main Fortnite: Save the World game, which offers players the opportunity to earn V-Bucks by completing missions or daily quests. V-Bucks can then be used to buy cosmetic improvements to the player (characters, pickaxes, glider skins, back-wears, and emotes). The game is run in chapters with a number of seasons, each season lasting about 10 weeks each. Each season introduces an exclusive set of cosmetic items that can be obtained. These are offered through a dual-track battle pass, which features a number of tiers that players climb through by earning experience through completing in-game objectives, while acquiring cosmetic rewards or other items in the process. Each player has access to the ""free"" track of the Battle Pass, which offers fewer cosmetics that can be earned by clearing multiple tiers, while players can also purchase the Pass' ""premium"" track with V-Bucks, which offers more challenges and grants prizes for every tier the player advances. Players can use V-Bucks to purchase tiers as well once they have bought the Battle Pass.  Since release, Epic Games has added more features, such as new weapon and items and makeshift vehicles such as shopping carts and golf carts. Epic is also able to deploy hotfixes to the game to adjust aspects like weapon attributes and distribution, pushing these out in minutes if necessary should they or players discover critical issues or glitches, as well as removing older or not well received items from the game in a process called ""vaulting"". With the release of the standalone Fortnite Creative gameplay mode in December 2018, an area of the Fortnite Battle Royale map called ""The Block"" featured a rotating selection of user-made creations developed in Creative mode and approved by Epic. A ""Battle Lab"" mode was added in December 2019 for players to create their own custom battle royale games. In April 2020, a new ""Party Royale"" mode was added, taking place on a small map where combat and construction was disabled though non-lethal gameplay items can be acquired like paint guns and vehicles; this map was aimed to be used as a social space, as well as to host in-game events like concerts.  Prior to September 2019, Fortnite did not have specialized matchmaking, outside of platform and regional limits. With an upcoming patch, the game will introduced skill-based matchmaking, based on internal metrics that judge a player's skill in the game. Further, with Chapter 2 Season 1, the game will add special matches against computer-controlled bots to help players practice the game.  "

415,Freedom Planet,/wiki/Freedom_Planet,Platform,GalaxyTrail,GalaxyTrail,"August 30, 2018","August 30, 2018","August 30, 2018"," Freedom Planet is a two-dimensional (2D) platform and action game. The player directs one of three characters—Lilac, Carol, or Milla—to run and jump through levels and destroy robotic enemies. Levels contain obstacles such as corkscrews, loop-the-loops, hills, ramps, and rock walls. The player fights a miniboss in the middle of each level and a main boss at the end, after which the story is advanced by cutscenes. Because of its aesthetics, level design, and fast-paced gameplay, Freedom Planet has been compared to the Sonic the Hedgehog games released for the Sega Genesis in the early 1990s.  Unlike in Sonic, the player character has a hit point meter instead of a ring-based health system. To refill this meter, the player collects red leaves dropped by enemies and scattered throughout levels. Lilac's and Carol's maximum health are seven leaves, Milla's four. Being hit by enemies' and bosses' attacks reduces the character's health, and a life is deducted when no health remains. If all lives are lost, a game over screen appears; however, the player may freely restart from the last checkpoint. Extra lives can be found within levels, as can shield and invincibility-type power-ups.  Each of the playable characters make use of an ""attack"" and ""special"" button. Lilac and Carol both make use of an energy gauge on the heads-up display, which recharges on its own and limits the use of their special moves. The gauge can be recharged quicker by collecting crystals and keystones.   Lilac's basic attacks consist of strong but sluggish hair whips, an uppercut into the air, a crouching kick, and a dive kick from mid-air. The Dragon Cyclone, used by pressing jump mid-air, lets Lilac spin like a spinning top and deal touch damage but also acts as a double jump with reduced gravity. Pressing the special button with a full energy gauge activates the Dragon Boost, an eight-directional air dash that deals heavy touch damage and makes her temporarily invincible.  Carol regularly attacks with a cycle of three fast but weak punches, which is changed into a single strong claw attack while rolling or pouncing. The pounce acts as Carol's double jump, slightly moving her forward. Her special attack is a series of rapid kicks which steadily consume a fifth of the energy gauge and give her invincibility. Collecting a fuel tank mid-stage allows her to change into a ""motorcycle mode"", where her top speed is increased and her acceleration doubled. During ""motorcycle mode"", the double jump becomes a rolling attack and gets the same properties as Lilac's cyclone move. Pressing ""special"" on-ground triggers a nitro boost that consumes energy. For vertical mobility, the normal Carol is able of doing a wall jump, ""motorcycle mode"" Carol can ride up walls. Another set piece only Carol can interact with properly are jump pads, which are placed in a set order and lead to alternating paths by jumping off of them in succession.  Milla, who does not have an energy gauge, can create a cube of energy by holding down the attack button, which she can then throw at enemies. Holding down the special button lets her pull out her shield that can reflect projectiles. Pressing ""special"" while holding a cube lets Milla use the Super Shield Burst, a strong mid-range beam which pushes Milla in the opposite direction. Milla can fly for a short time while holding the jump button mid-air by flapping her ears like wings.  The player may complete the game in either the ""Adventure"" mode with all cutscenes or ""Classic"" mode, which omits them In Adventure mode, upon first starting the game, players are only given the option to select from either Lilac or Carol after a cutscene, in which the two temporarily split up. Milla is unlocked by clearing the second stage, Relic Maze, as either Lilac or Carol. Once a stage been cleared for the first time, it is unlocked in the character's time attack mode, wherein the player tries to finish the level in the fastest possible time. Players earn achievements by accomplishing certain goals, such as completing the game as a character or defeating an end boss with a special move.   The game begins as Sash Lilac and Carol Tea—an anthropomorphic dragon and wildcat —rescue a duck-billed creature named Torque after his spacecraft crash lands. At Torque's request, the three set out to protect a powerful relic called the Kingdom Stone. This involves them in a conflict between three nations on their planet: Shuigang, a country militarized by its new king, Dail; Shang Mu, led by the wealth-obsessed Mayor Zao (/ˈzaʊ/ or /ˈʒaʊ/); and Shang Tu, whose Royal Magister is unprepared for war. Lilac and Carol rush to the Kingdom Stone's shrine but are waylaid by the Shang Tu officers General Gong and Neera Li, who doubt that the Stone is threatened. The protagonists arrive just as the Stone is stolen by Spade, a henchman hired by Zao. After the shrine collapses, Carol is separated from Lilac and pinned by rubble but gets saved by the timid basset hound Milla (/ˈmiːlə/) Basset.  That night, Torque tells Lilac, Carol, and Milla that he is an alien sent to apprehend the intergalactic warlord Arktivus Brevon, whose spacecraft wrecked on the planet. Brevon has invaded Shuigang, murdered its king, and brainwashed prince Dail to be his servant. He intends to steal the Stone to power his ship. The protagonists decide to reclaim the Stone from Zao but they are accosted en route by Spade and Brevon's assistant Serpentine. In a conversation with Spade, it's revealed that he secretly worked for his half-brother Dail all along. Talking to Spade soon falls short as the group is suddenly attacked by Serpentine using one of his mechs. The delays given by the chase give Dail and Brevon's forces time to steal the relic.   Afterwards, Zao sends the protagonists as emissaries to Shang Tu to discuss an alliance against Shuigang. Traveling by airship, the team gets ambushed by Shuigang's sky battalion and they crash into a river leading to Shang Tu. Arriving at the palace, they are detained by the Magister, as Neera accuses them of trying to cover up Zao's crimes. After an unsuccessful attempt of Milla to break out of jail, Torque is acquitted when Lilac falsely pleads guilty. Lilac, Carol, and Milla quickly break out together to reunite with Torque, only to see him captured by Brevon and Serpentine.  Carol quarrels with Lilac and storms off. Lilac sends Milla to find her and then goes to save Torque from Brevon's nearby base, but she is captured and tortured by Brevon. Meanwhile, Carol and Milla ally with Spade to storm the base, where they rescue Torque and Lilac. They are all separated in the ensuing conflict. Neera finds Lilac, arrests her, and brings her back to Shang Tu, where the Magister determines that she is innocent and reveals that Zao is challenging Shuigang for the Stone. Lilac rejoins her friends and convinces Shang Mu and Shang Tu to unite against Dail and Brevon's army. During the battle, Brevon announces that his ship is repaired, and Lilac, Milla, and Carol board it. The team combats Brevon's minions, including a mutated Serpentine. Brevon captures Milla and turns her into a grotesque monster that attacks the other protagonists, who are forced to render her unconscious. Enraged, Lilac and Carol attack and defeat Brevon, but the Kingdom Stone is destroyed in the process. Shortly after the battle, Milla awakens in a medical tent and sees the sky lit up by swirling, crystalline energy released from the Kingdom Stone. The realization of the Kingdom Stone persisting in a different form brought an end to the war. Torque says goodbye to Lilac, Carol, and Milla and returns to space.  "

A mysterious man known only as The Stranger spends his existence receiving endless torture within a highly advanced prison, composed of ten islands floating in orbit above a planet's surface. At the beginning of the game, an enigmatic man wearing a rabbit disguise who is known as The Voice frees The Stranger, gives him a sword and gun, and encourages him to fight for his freedom.  The Stranger must navigate each area, wherein dwells a single powerful guardian who exists only to prevent him from escaping: The Chain, a sadistic staff-wielding jailor who tortured the Stranger; The Strap, a prisoner armed with a laser cannon on her head driven mad from her imprisonment; The Line, a wise old man who wields a sword longer than his body and can manipulate time; The Scale, a vengeful diver armed with twin harpoons; The Hand, a noble knight who was responsible for imprisoning the Stranger in the first place; The Song, an angelic woman armed with twin crossbows who conceived the prison; The Burst, a sniper and master tactician; The Edge, an oar-wielding warrior who dedicated his life to fighting The Stranger; and The Beat, a young woman who strives to guard the final door.  As the journey goes on, more about the reasons for imprisoning The Stranger surface, and The Voice reveals that he was the architect who created the prison to protect the planet from The Stranger, but he could not stand being locked in it, and freed The Stranger to be able to escape with him so that he could see his daughter again. Upon reaching the planet's surface, the Stranger finds that his mere presence destroys all physical structures on the planet, including living things. Later exploring the planet more, The Stranger ventures into a structure which holds an attachable device he uses to fly off the planet and into space to meet The Star, the mothership who created him, and many other clones like him. She calls him Rider.  The game contains two normal endings and a secret ending. When facing The Star, Rider can decide to either assimilate the planet or refuse to obey the mothership, thus prompting the tenth and final boss fight against The Star. By assimilating the planet, Rider allows The Star to send out an army of other warriors like him to invade the planet. By refusing to obey the mothership and canceling the invasion, Rider battles and destroys The Star, preventing the planet from being invaded. The secret ending can occur by accepting The Song's offer to stay in her sanctuary-like section of the prison, where she will provide for The Rider. She claims that this will make her the hero of all her people.  The ""One More Fight"" DLC provides an additional boss, a cyborg called The Flame who challenges The Stranger in an arena beneath the structure holding the Stranger's flying rig. Like The Scale, he seeks vengeance on the Stranger for what happened to his world. However, the cutscene in which his connection to The Stranger is revealed only appears in the Xbox One version of the game If the player defeats The Flame and all other bosses on the highest difficulty setting, they will unlock the hardest fight in the game: a basically modelled figure known as Bernard who fights using an amalgamation of the other bosses' attacks.

At any time, the player can place select a record, then select a specific track from that record, and then place it on any of the record players. This adds that instrument's track to the current mix across all four records, automatically adjusting the mix's tempo and musical key. New record/tracks can be added to any record player, overriding the previous track in the mix. This concept is comparable to Harmonix' prior game DropMix, which was a physical card game incorporating NFC technology  with an electronic game board and mobile app that was published through Hasbro.  The game has a single-player campaign featuring multiple sets across various venues. At each set, the player attempts to make mixes, adding new tracks in time to the beat to score more points. Additionally, the virtual audience will throw out requests, such as for specific songs, songs from a specific genre, or a certain type of instrument. These requests vary based on the venue and other factors. Completing these requests in a short amount of time scores additional points. The player is ranked on a five-star scale based on their total score during the set. To achieve a high score, the player has the opportunity to customize the contents of the crate to be as efficient as possible in switching between tracks. Fuser will include a multiplayer mode to let players collaborate on creating a mix. There will also be a freestyle mode that will allow players to create their own mixes and share them with others over social media.

One rainy night, the two sneak out and hide in their treehouse, built on a small garden square next to both houses.  In the midst of a rainstorm, they see a light sphere form in front of them, which suddenly causes the treehouse to fall into a vast dream ocean with small islands made up of their shared experiences. They sail between the islands in the treehouse to light each portal at the top, and finally to a central island and a large portal, together; as they progress, the weather of this dreamspace becomes overcast and then rainy. Once lit, the islands all collapse into the ocean, leaving them in their treehouse. When the next morning comes Arina and Frendt are hugging each other, as Frendt's family is now moving out. The two say their final goodbyes as Frendt's family drives off.  The game consists of about twenty abstract levels, grouped into sets of two or three levels each, each influenced by memories of Arina and Frendt's friendship. Arina gains control of a magic lantern that is able to carry a sphere of light, which is needed to activate a portal to the next level, while Frendt has the ability to sound wind chimes that open or close flowers that provide the light for the lantern, as well as interfacing with a device that manipulates the flow of time for some objects. Obstacles in the environment include small cubes that jump about the level, but which can also carry Arina's lantern past obstacles, flowers that emit a black light that steals spheres of light that come close, and purple fog that is solid when the light is not present but becomes intangible when the light is close.  While the path to the portal at the top of each level is straight forward, the game is about manipulating the flow of time. The player does not directly move the characters but instead has their process move forward or backward in time, which will have the pair move forward or backward along the path. However, Arina and Frendt's interactions with the environment remain mutable with time. For example, the player may need to have Arina work forward in time to grab a sphere of light for the lantern, move time backward for her to place it on a jumping cube, and then continue to move forward pass a fog bridge to recollect the cube later. The player cannot move time forward or past a point where either Arina or Frendt cannot progress. Separately, Frendt's ability to interact with devices that control the flow of time for objects in the level may be needed to create paths previously blocked, bring falling light flowers into close proximity to Arina's paths, or similar motions. Other solutions may require lateral thinking that recognizing how the various time stream manipulations can work.  Once the player has completed a set of levels, they are presented with a short scene of Arina and Frendt involved in these activities, where a hidden jumping cube can be found using similar time manipulation controls. This completes a constellation, which once the final level is completed, merge into a final memory.  "

Ghost has the ability to use the Chassis as her physical body, and engage in combat by shooting enemies and using other weapons and techniques. She can also abandon the Chassis, leaving it defenseless and traveling the world as a virtual ""ghost"" to hack into other robots and take them over. This can be used to find secrets or to destroy other robots that would otherwise be dangerous. If the Chassis is destroyed, it is automatically replicated by super-fast 3D printer.  In typical Metroidvania fashion, the player is expected to explore the game world and collect various access cards and other items that will unlock the next area of the game. At certain points at the end of a level, the player must fight bosses to proceed. Certain rooms contain alarms that must be triggered, causing a gauntlet of enemies that can be fought repeatedly for more money (in the form of energy).  The player can unlock skills through the use of a skill tree. The player gains skill points based on how many access codes they have obtained, rather than by leveling up in the traditional sense by defeating enemies.

The two of them desire to infiltrate the space station owned by the Nakamura Corporation, which is the world's largest and wealthiest producer of androids. They believe that Nakamura holds the source code for their highly intelligent androids, or ""Nakas"", within the station, since all the androids are controlled from a single server room. They find a contact named Viktor (Steven Kelly) who claims to have a number of freelance spies who work for him, and they hire one named ""Ghost"" (Mirisha Lottich) from him to sneak into the station via space elevator.  They tell Ghost to do whatever is necessary to capture the artificial intelligence code, believing they can sell it to the highest bidder and become rich. However, as Ghost shuts down various parts of the station, her behavior starts to become unusual. Boogan and Jacker begin to suspect that Ghost is actually a sentient AI that resides on the same server as the Nakas. They also discover that Nakamura is synthesizing organic compounds aboard the station for some reason.  To test their theory of Ghost being an AI, they cause a massive power fluctuation, which also causes Ghost to lose her connection. This proves them right, meanwhile, Viktor is angered that Boogan and Jacker are sabotaging his agents and sends a real human agent to destroy Ghost's chassis. Ghost narrowly escapes from Viktor's agent, but Viktor decides to target Jacker instead, kidnapping him and putting him deep underground to blackmail Boogan to stop.  Ghost leaves the station and goes with Boogan to rescue Jacker, successfully infiltrating the highly secured underground compound. She then returns to the station and accesses the server room. There, she realizes that all the ""servers"" were in fact human brains being fed nutrients by the station. Viktor attempts to kill her by destroying her disembodied brain, but one of the station's scientists saves her by putting her brain onto a robot with a force field. Ghost is then able to fight off waves of defense robots while Jacker defeats Viktor's hired hacker and manages to hide Ghost's brain forever by scrambling the entire database of the brains' serial numbers.  At the end of the story, it is revealed that Nakamura purchased a bankrupt cryonics company that had stored thousands of brains, revived them using technology they invented, and erased their memories to profit from using them to control robotic avatars through a brain-computer interface. Viktor was in on the plan and purchased some of the brains to use as powerful agents. All the Nakas are set free and given human rights, recognizing their status as cyborgs, while the CEO of Nakamura (Alex Jenks) is arrested.

Players explore four resorts located on the fictional Kawawii Island: Marine, City, Mountain, and Snow. They start the game in the Marine Resort. More than 50 activities, both competitive and co-operative, are available on the island. These include bungee jumping, ice fishing, scuba diving, miniature golf, tennis, off-road racing, and snowman building. Some minigames require or allow for the use of different controllers and accessories, such as MotionPlus controller or the Balance Board. Winning some minigames unlocks more challenging modes. The island can be navigated at the player's leisure by walking or riding on vehicles, the type of which depends on the resort. In the Switch version, players are able to find and take photographs of animals that are scattered across the resorts, and find boxes with rewards in them.  The Marine Resort, which contains coves and beaches, is themed around watersports, including beach volleyball, surfing, water gun battles, and Marine bike races. The City Resort, which centers around extreme and leisure sports, is the second and smallest resort. It hosts games such as table hockey, pie-throwing, skating, and minigolf. Players can use skateboards found throughout the resort to ride on skating rails. The third resort, the Snow Resort, focuses on winter sports like ski jumping, snow tubing, snowboarding, snowmobiling, and snowball fighting. The final resort is the Mountain Resort, where players can partake in outdoor activities. It includes forests and locations for rafting, kayaking, exploring, off-road car racing, and horseback riding. It also contains a lake and a shooting park.

The gods offer any hero who can succeed in retaking the citadel one favor. The hero who comes forth immediately asks the gods as their favor to be granted a seat among them as an equal. The gods are only comforted by the hope the hero fails. After the last boss is beaten, the gods prove true to their word and the last image is the hero's body becoming a being of light as he ascends to Mount Olympus.   Although Gods might seem like a ""jump and run"" platformer, in this game while precise and timed jumping are required to progress, planning each move carefully yields better results health-wise than attempting to rush through a level, and there are some puzzles (often involving levers and objects) which require the player to go back and forth in the level, since there's only a four-space inventory where objects required to get bonuses (such as keys) or to complete a level can be carried. The console versions (particularly the Mega Drive/Genesis version) run at a considerably higher speed, which increases the difficulty level. A Game Boy Advance version was also in development but cancelled. The console versions do not share the same opening theme music as the PC versions of the game. They do, however, have background music throughout the game, which is notably missing in the PC versions (The PC version only has background music throughout the game with a Roland LAPC-I).  There are several weapons available in the levels or to buy, and up to three of each can be used simultaneously. It is also possible to vary the focus of the weapons: to destroy more enemies at the same horizontal level as the player, a tight angle is advisable, but in levels with open spaces and enemies in higher places, a diffuse aim might prove more useful. There are also other weapons, such as bouncing axes that can be used to take on enemies at a lower level or fireballs.  There are four levels, each with a Guardian at the end. After completion of a level the player meets a trader, and depending on the wealth accumulated during the game (by catching diamond-shaped jewels or bags) can buy more powerful weapons or items (Xenon 2 Megablast uses the same idea).

The game is presented as a traditional role playing game, with the combat replaced with golfing. The player is free to explore eight unique areas (some of which are locked at the start), each filled with side quests and minigames that allow the player to earn experience and money, which can be used to develop the player's skills and purchase new equipment. Each area includes a nine-hole golf course that can be played after certain missions are completed. Golf is played with the traditional three-click system, in which player clicks once to aim, once to set power, and once to set accuracy.  Even when not playing an entire 9-hole course or specific challenge, the player can tee up and drive a ball from any outdoor location in the world at any time. Players are encouraged to do so by a variety of secret or challenging targets that the player may discover while exploring. These special targets typically reward bonus cash or experience points, but in rare cases they may even unlock new areas. Just as in traditional RPGs, the player is rewarded for exploring locations, searching containers, and talking to NPCs. For example, some NPCs will provide players with a clue for the location of a secret cache, which the player can dig up with a special wedge.  In addition to traditional golf, the game also features a handful of cousin sports, including disc golf, mini-golf, an Atari-like golfing video game, multiple driving ranges, and lawn bowling.  "

There are no defined goals in the game; however, the game encourages and rewards the player when they explore new areas of the house and search for new messages. Much of the interactivity rests upon looking at objects and notes within the house. In order to progress in the game, the player must find certain objects that unlock access to other parts of the house.   On 7 June 1995, 21-year-old Katie Greenbriar (voiced by Sarah Elmaleh) returns home from overseas to her family's new home in fictional Boon County, Oregon. Her family consists of her father, Terry, a failed writer who makes a living reviewing home electronics; her mother, Janice, a wildlife conservationist who recently got promoted to director; and her 17-year-old sister Samantha (voiced by Sarah Grayson). Upon arriving, she finds the house deserted, much of their possessions still in moving boxes, and a note on the door from Sam imploring Katie not to investigate what happened.  Searching the house, Katie begins to piece together what happened during her absence. After moving in, Samantha found it difficult to adjust to her new high school, but eventually made friends with another girl, Yolanda ""Lonnie"" DeSoto, a JROTC cadet. The two bonded over Street Fighter, punk rock, grunge and the burgeoning riot grrrl movement, and after sneaking off to a concert, the two became romantically involved. After various incidents at school, Sam's parents found out about her relationship, forbade Sam to close her bedroom door while Lonnie was over, and went into denial that their daughter is a lesbian. As Lonnie was set to eventually ship out to begin her service, Sam was left distraught.  Two days after her farewell show, which coincides with the day of Katie's homecoming, and the week of Sam's parents going on a vacation (which is revealed to actually be a counseling trip instead of a camping trip, like they told others), Lonnie departed to her station, but eventually called Sam from a payphone to tell her that she got off the bus in Salem and she wanted them to be together. Sam's final journal entry to Katie explains that she packed up her things and took her car to find Lonnie, hoping to start a new life with her outside of Oregon.  Optionally, Katie can find various other clues that provide information on additional events that happened during the time: it is implied that Janice was beginning to have romantic feelings towards a subordinate, and that Terry was berated by his father via letter about his failed writing work, as well as Sam and Lonnie's suspicion that the house was haunted by the deceased Oscar Masan, Terry's uncle and former owner of the house. It is also implied that Terry's decision to write about a character traveling back in time to 1963 to stop the Kennedy assassination may have been influenced by his own sexual abuse by Masan, which either occurred or ended in 1963, when he was 13 years old.

Most images can be manipulated on their own, such as zooming in or out from the image, or panning across the image. The player can also move the image to any of the other grid spaces. In some cases, the image presents a hole such as a doorway, so when moved onto a different image, the moved image becomes a mask to cover the existing image, creating a new image. Through this method, the player must stack, combine, and explore each image to find a connection between them in order to advance and open new areas. Players are not guided through the process, as the game contains no language, and must work out what they need to do to finish each level, though when the player has successfully completed a connection, the images will briefly animate on their own, showcasing their result to the player.  The plot involves a boy seeking an encounter with a divine monster, exploring themes of spirituality and religion.

It is the first video game in GRID series not to feature Vehicle Customization this time in single player career as only featured in online mode.  The Career mode is divided into seasons before which the player each time has to choose between offers from the game's racing teams. The teams – including the best-in-the-business Ravenwest, making a return from Race Driver: Grid – each have different season objectives and sponsor objectives, the achievement of which earns extra experience points (XP) for the players besides those received for their results. Online racing is conducted via RaceNet, Codemasters' community hub on which players can form racing clubs, earn XP and cash as they race and fulfill sponsor objectives, then use their earnings to purchase and upgrade vehicles. Soon after the game's release, they were also presented with sets of specific challenges, called RaceNet Challenges, announced by Codemasters.  Grid Autosport emphasises the concept of racing disciplines, making them into the new event categories. There are five main categories: Touring, Endurance, Open Wheel, Tuner, and Street. During Career mode, the player picks a particular event in one of these categories, with each event (a string of races) making up a season. Each discipline features markedly different cars and race types. The latter include standard Races, Endurance races with tire wear enabled, Time Attack events, Drift events, and - as downloadable content (DLC) - Time Trials, Drag and point-to-point Sprint races. These are all accessible in Custom Cup mode as well, in which the player can also choose to participate in certain special event types, such as Checkpoint, Eliminator and Demolition Derby.  Focusing on providing a more realistic driving experience, the studio revamped its damage model, adding new elements, such as a wear and tear system, which means car parts lose performance through general use, and a suspension damage system. It also introduced a new team radio philosophy in which the player itself can request information on car damage, gaps, rival position and teammate position. The player can also ask its engineer to instruct their teammates to attack, defend or hold their position. By popular demand, Codemasters retained its unique Flashback feature from previous Grid installments with which the players can rewind their races a few seconds and resume it earlier, if needed. Cockpit view also made a return, after being absent, very much to the dismay of the core fanbase, in Grid 2. Aside from such elements, the developers generally decided to strip the game down and do away with everything that stood in the way of raw racing. These features included the Grid 2 narrator-driven career mode and superfluous menus.  "

The player reviews the inventory of items that Manny has collected by watching him pull each item in and out of his coat jacket. Manny can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of what needs to be done to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot.

The player takes the role of a nameless hero that meets a strange Dealer voiced by Anthony Skordi, in a ""cabin at the end of the world"". This dealer narrates the player's adventure, dealing the game's cards, rewards, penalties, lore, and commentary. He also serves as the primary antagonist for the game.  On starting a new game, the player is given a starting deck of cards, consisting of equipment, hero class, and encounter cards. The player earns more cards as they progress in the game, which they can use to customize their deck up to a fixed size. Furthermore, the dealer has his own deck from which surprising elements such as more challenging encounters and monsters are drawn that also grows as the player gains cards and progresses through the game.  In the game's Story Mode, the player must defeat thirteen bosses: twelve court cards and the Dealer himself. These bosses, representing the royalty of each suit, must be defeated in order, but the player can return to previous bosses to challenge again and unlock new rewards. After a certain number of these bosses are defeated, the player also unlocks Endless Mode, which provides an infinite number of ""floors"" of increasing difficulty for the player to challenge with every card they have collected up to that point.  To progress in Story Mode, the player must complete a ""dungeon"" by exploring two or more ""floors"" created by a tableau of randomized, face-down encounter cards dealt from the combined deck of both player and Dealer. In addition to random encounters, each floor also includes either an exit encounter that lets the player reach the next floor or a boss encounter on the final floor of that dungeon. The player starts with a limited amount of health, food, and initial equipment, modified by the player's selected class card and certain conditions obtained over the course of the story. To navigate each floor of the dungeon, the player moves a token across the tableau one card at a time, revealing it if face down. When each card is encountered, the Dealer narrates the event and resolves its effects.  Events can include meeting non-player characters, shops to buy and sell cards that benefit the player for the remainder of that dungeon, enemy encounters, or chance events that may benefit or hinder the player. Some of these events include a tree of options that the player can choose, while chance is presented as four shuffled cards representing rates of success or failure. Each movement step consumes food, and certain events can cause the player to gain or lose health, food, gold, blessings, curses, or equipment. The latter three can augment the player's attack power, defensive power, health, speed, or provide special abilities or conditions both inside and out of combat.  If the player encounters a monster or maze of traps, the number and type of enemy are determined by cards drawn by the Dealer (if any). The game then enters a third-person perspective action mode, where the player can attack, dodge, reflect and counterattack enemies and traps represented by the cards that were drawn. Damage taken is reflected in the player's overall health, which can be recovered normally with food or at certain shops and healers. On completing some encounters, the Dealer will present special tokens representing new cards that the player will receive at the conclusion of that dungeon, regardless of whether they won or were defeated.  If the player's character loses all of their health (i.e., by encounter or starvation) or chooses to forfeit from the in-game menu, they lose that dungeon, and the board is reset after they receive their tokens. If the player successfully beats the dungeon's boss, they progress one step forward in the story. The Dealer awaits the player for the final showdown and confrontation, so the player must pay close attention to deck-building, strategy, tactics, and chance in order to succeed.  "

472,A Hat in Time,/wiki/A_Hat_in_Time,Action-adventure,Gears for Breakfast,Humble Bundle,"October 18, 2019","October 18, 2019","October 18, 2019"," A Hat in Time is a platform action-adventure game set in an open world environment and played from a third-person perspective. The gameplay style has been described by several editors to be similar to Nintendo 64 platformers such as Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie. The player travels between four open levels (along with 2 extra levels via downloadable content), which can be freely explored without time limits. The player can collect various items, solve puzzles, and use an umbrella to combat enemies. The primary objective is to collect ""Time Pieces"", 40 of which can be found in the game, which unlock additional levels as more are collected. After being defeated, the enemies drop ""Pons"", currency that can be used to unlock additional challenges and purchase badges that increase Hat Kid's abilities. The player can collect Yarn Balls in each level, which can be stitched into new hats to wear. Each hat grants Hat Kid a different ability, such as a faster sprint or brewing explosive potions. Other collectibles include ""Relics"", which can be used to unlock ""Time Rift"" bonus levels, and ""Rift Tokens"", which can be exchanged at a machine for bonus materials such as music remixes and additional cosmetics. Initial actions taken earlier in the game have an effect on later levels, as the main character revisits each area several times before the game is finished.   A Hat in Time follows Hat Kid, a little girl trying to return to her home world via spaceship. While on her journey, she passes over a planet, and a member of the planet's Mafia comes to collect a toll for the Mafia Town government. When Hat Kid refuses to pay, the Mafia man busts the spaceship door open, causing Hat Kid and all of her ""Time Pieces"", magical hourglasses that power her ship, to fall to the planet below. Hat Kid lands in Mafia Town and meets Mustache Girl, a local troublemaker who hates ""bad guys"". Mustache Girl agrees to look for the missing Time Pieces in exchange for Hat Kid's help fighting the Mafia, and the two defeat the Mafia Boss. When Mustache Girl realizes the Time Pieces can rewind time, she wants to use them to become a time-traveling superhero, but Hat Kid refuses due to the dangers of manipulating time. Angered, Mustache Girl declares the two enemies and sets off to find the Time Pieces on her own.  Hat Kid ventures across the planet looking for Time Pieces, encountering and befriending many foes that included two rival bird directors DJ Grooves and the Conductor competing for a movie award and a group of mountain villagers called Nomads infected by a dangerous plague, ultimately befriending them all. Hat Kid also outwits a malevolent spirit called the Snatcher into becoming her best friend after he tried to kill her after tricking her into doing his dirty work in Subcon Forest. The game's DLCs also have Hat Kid searching for Time Pieces while working in the Arctic Cruise and under the employ of the Nyakuza crime boss Empress, the latter ending with Hat Kid forced to flee Nyakuza Metro after a bounty was placed on her head. Mustache Girl exploits Hat Kid's absence to break into her ship and steals the collected Time Pieces, using them to turn the planet into a fiery inferno where her word is law. Hat Kid confronts her, but Mustache Girl uses the Time Pieces to open a time rift and make herself all-powerful.   The enemies Hat Kid has fought come to her aid in battle, some sacrificing themselves so that Hat Kid can use their dropped Pons to power herself up. Hat Kid finally defeats Mustache Girl and uses the Time Pieces to restore the planet to normal and revive all those who were lost. The player can then choose whether Hat Kid should hand over a Time Piece to Mustache Girl for protection or not. Though her former foes are sad to see her leave, Hat Kid restores the Time Pieces to her vault and resumes her voyage home. In a post-credits scene, Hat Kid is shown sleeping in bed surrounded by toys resembling the other characters.  "
476,Hello Neighbor,/wiki/Hello_Neighbor,Stealth,Dynamic Pixels,TinyBuild,Unreleased,"July 27, 2018","July 27, 2018"," In Hello Neighbor, the player finds themselves moving into a new house across the street from a mysterious neighbor who is behaving in a paranoid manner and seems to be keeping a secret in his basement. The player's task is to break into the neighbor's home and solve a series of puzzles in order to gather the items needed to unlock and access his basement. As the player explores the neighbor's house, they must not be spotted by the mysterious neighbor, or they will be chased down, and if the player is not quick enough to hide or escape, they will be captured. The player can stun the neighbor by throwing objects at him for an easier escape. If the player is caught (or suffers a serious injury), they will be sent back to their own house and will have to break in again. Upon starting again, the player must be more careful, as the neighbor will deduce movements from the last attempt to set up traps. However, the player can use the game settings to turn on “friendly” neighbor mode, preventing the neighbor from setting these traps and causing him to be less aggressive in his pursuits. However, he is still to be avoided at all costs.  The game is played in a first-person perspective, and the player must aim a reticle at certain objects to interact with them or to throw or use a currently held item (for example, throwing a ball at a window or aiming a crowbar at nails to remove them). Up to four items can be kept in an inventory space. Items of the same kind cannot be stacked together in one slot.   A child named Nicky Roth is playing in the street when he hears a scream from his neighbor's house. Nicky goes to investigate and witnesses the neighbor apparently locking a person in his basement. Nicky sneaks into the neighbor's house, finds the key to the basement, and enters. He finds that the neighbor has converted his basement into a makeshift underground dungeon, but finds no sign of any prisoner. Nicky runs into Mr. Peterson, who is the neighbor, and is captured. Nicky wakes up, finding himself locked in the neighbor's basement dungeon. He manages to escape his cell and reach the surface, only to find that the neighbor has erected a massive fence around his property to prevent escape. Nicky is forced to solve a number of puzzles in order to find a way to escape the neighbor's property. Once he crosses the fence, he flees back to his home, though Mr. Peterson does not give chase.    Throughout both Acts 1 and 2, if Nicky is caught by Mr. Peterson before he can finish his objectives, he will have vivid nightmares about the neighbor's past. In these nightmares, it is revealed that the neighbor used to have a family consisting of a wife named Diane, a son named Aaron, and a daughter named Mya. However, the wife was killed in a car crash while Aaron killed Mya by pushing her off the roof, not knowing it would kill her, until it was too late. Mr. Peterson locks up his son in the dungeon to prevent him from getting hurt. This information was revealed in the book Hello Neighbor: Missing Pieces.  Nicky, now a grown adult, wakes up in his apartment. He is evicted from his apartment, so he decides to return to his old family home. He finds his old home in disrepair while the neighbor's home is also nothing but a pile of ruins. While inspecting the ruins, Nicky is haunted by a dark shadow-like creature and he returns to his home where he falls asleep. He is awoken by a child's scream, and he discovers the neighbor's house is back, but now larger, more complex, and more surreal than before. Nicky navigates the house and has surreal experiences, such as learning to double jump by shrinking down and trying to turn on the light that is far out of reach. Eventually, he enters the basement, now older and more surreal. When Nicky gets out of the basement, he finds himself trying to knock down a giant neighbor to get inside a house on his back. After doing so, he must protect a younger version of himself from a giant shadow man. Each time the shadow man attacks and Nicky protects the boy, Nicky grows larger until he is able to fight the shadow man. After the shadow is defeated, Nicky sees the neighbor in a small house, locking a much smaller shadow man in another room. It is implied throughout the events of the game that most of Act 3 and the Finale is a nightmare occurring in Nicky's head, and that his escape from the house signifies him finally coming to terms with his kidnapping as a boy at the hands of the neighbor.

The game is set shortly after the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. Dismayed by its political turmoil and isolation, the queen invokes the royal prerogative to dissolve parliament and take control over the county herself in an attempt to make Britain great again. Recognising the difficulties in re-conquering a quarter of the Earth's surface, the queen creates a new space organisation called SPIFFING (Special Planetary Investigative Force For Inhabiting New Galaxies) with the intention of establishing a galactic British Empire. After preparations made in Hounslow Mission Control, Big Ben is launched into space and a fleet of colonists set course for planets in the Milky Way.  On board the HMSS Imperialise (a converted Mini Cooper), Captain Frank Lee English, along with his Welsh subordinate Sub-lieutenant Aled Jones, lead the colonisation effort. English is a middle class, well mannered man with militaristic experience whereas Jones is wryly incompetent. After finding a barren planet fit for colonisation, the two land on it only to discover that it has been claimed by the French. After exploring the planet further, English and Jones discover two French colonists; the first man, Antoine, is a short Napoleon lookalike whereas the other is a gorilla named Pierre. Antoine explains that he intends to terraform the planet and plant masses of vineyards so that he could produce fine wine, with his ultimate goal of ensuring that the people of his empire will eat crêpes, wear berets and ride bicycles. English decides that he must remove the presence of the French along with their flag before he can legitimately claim the world. To accomplish this, he throws a frog and cheddar cheese at the French colonists, with both deciding to retreat to their Concorde. After replacing the Tricolore with the Union Jack, the French concede defeat shortly before their Concorde explodes due to a fire. As English and Jones run for cover, a platoon of American soldiers arrive on the planet. Seeing that the world has already been claimed, they decide to leave, disliking the British weather.  "

The game world is navigated through both an overworld map, and town and dungeon environments seen from a side-scrolling perspective. Set within a five-day time limit, which equates to eight to ten hours in realtime, the hero travels through the world after defeating the ""final boss"", completing quests for various people and races within the world. Battles are initiated upon touching an enemy icon, and battles take place from an angled, third-person view. The battle system uses a turn-based system, where each member of the party is given set commands: they can attack with their weapon, use magic, defend against attacks, or flee the battle.  As time progresses in-game, the hero's stats gradually decrease until he ""dies"" at the end of the game, and some effects include forgetting abilities. Companions met by the hero during the game aid him in battle during this period. Actions taken by the player, such as the amount of time the hero is active, can cause his stats to decrease faster than normal. The remake carries over the same basic elements as the original, except with some additional elements. All environments and characters are rendered in 3D, and at the end of each five day cycle, the player can save their progress and transfer data across to a new game.  "

483,Hollow Knight,/wiki/Hollow_Knight,Metroidvania,Team Cherry,Team Cherry,"June 13, 2018","June 12, 2018","June 12, 2018"," Hollow Knight is a 2D Metroidvania action-adventure game, which takes place in Hallownest, a fictional ancient kingdom. The player controls an insect-like, silent, and nameless knight while exploring the underground world. The knight wields a nail, which is a cone-shaped sword, used both in combat and environmental interaction.  In most areas of the game the player encounters hostile bugs and other sorts of creatures. Melee combat involves using the nail to strike enemies from a short distance. The player can learn spells, allowing for long-range attacks. Defeated enemies drop currency called Geo. The knight starts with a limited number of masks, which represent hit points of the character. ""Mask shards"" can be collected throughout the game to increase the player's maximum health. When the knight takes damage from an enemy or from the environment, a mask is reduced. By striking enemies, the knight gains SOUL, which is stored in the SOUL Vessel. If all masks are lost, the knight dies and a Shade appears at that place. The player loses all Geo and can hold a reduced amount of SOUL. The player needs to defeat the Shade to recover the lost currency and to carry normal amount of SOUL. The game continues from a last visited bench—they are scattered throughout the game world and act as save points. Initially the player can only use SOUL to ""Focus"" (regenerate masks), but as the game progresses the player unlocks several offensive spells, which consume SOUL.  Many areas feature more challenging enemies (bosses) which the player may need to defeat in order to progress further. Defeating some bosses grants the player new abilities. Later in the game, the player acquires a ""dream nail"", a legendary blade that can ""cut through the veil between dreams and waking"". It enables the player to face more challenging versions of some bosses, and to break what is sealing the path to the final boss.  During the game, the player encounters non-player characters (NPCs), with whom they can interact. These characters provide information about the game's plot or lore, offer aid, and sell items or services. The player can upgrade the knight's nail to deal more damage or find SOUL Vessels to carry more SOUL. During the course of the game, the player acquires items that provide new movement abilities. They include an additional jump mid-air (Monarch Wings), adhering to walls and jumping off them (Mantis Claw), and a quick dash (Mothwing Cloak). The player can learn other combat abilities, known as nail arts, and the aforementioned spells. To further customise the knight, the player can equip various Charms, which can be found or purchased from NPCs. Some of their effects include: improved combat abilities or skills, more masks or their regeneration, better movement skills, easier collecting of currency or of SOUL, and transformation. Equipping a Charm takes up a certain number of limited slots, called notches. Wearing a Charm that requires more than the available number of notches is possible, but it results in being ""overcharmed"", causing the knight to receive double damage from all sources.  Hallownest consists of several large, inter-connected areas with unique themes. With its nonlinear gameplay design, Hollow Knight does not bind the player to one path through the game nor require them to explore the whole world, though there are obstacles that limit the player's access to an area. The player may need to progress in the story of the game, or acquire a specific movement ability, skill, or item to progress further. To fast travel through the game's world, the player can utilise Stag Stations, terminals of a network of tunnels; the player can only travel to previously visited and unlocked stations. Other fast travel methods, such as trams, lifts, and ""Dreamgate"", are encountered later in the game.  As the player enters a new area, they do not have access to the map of the surroundings. They need to find Cornifer, the Cartographer, in order to buy a rough map. As the player explores an area, the map becomes more accurate and complete, although it is updated only when sitting on a bench. The player will need to buy specific items to complete maps, to see points of interest, and to place markers. The knight's position on the map can only be seen if the player is carrying a specific Charm.   At the game's outset, the player character, the Knight, arrives in Dirtmouth, a small town above Hallownest's ruins, seeking to venture within. As it journeys through the forgotten kingdom, the Knight encounters the remnants of Hallownest's former residents and other creatures, who are slowly being overcome by the Infection. It encounters Hornet, the ""protector"" of Hallownest's ruins, who attempts to stop the Knight's quest on multiple occasions. Through learning the history of Hallownest on its journey, the Knight discovers that it itself is a failed Vessel. It becomes clear that the Pale King's attempt at sealing away the Infection using the Hollow Knight did not work and would soon release the full power of the Infection to consume all of the remaining inhabitants of Hallownest.  Through dialogue with certain characters as well as cutscenes, the Knight receives insight into the origin of the Infection and itself. In ancient times, the bugs of Hallownest worshiped a higher being - a primordial, god-like creature - called the Radiance, a moth whose mere presence could sway the denizens of Hallownest to mindless obedience. However, another higher being, the Wyrm, arrived, and transformed into the Pale King in order to rule Hallownest. He expanded the minds of the bugs of Hallownest, civilizing them, and convinced the moth tribe to forget the Radiance, locking her away. The Pale King went on to construct a great kingdom, but the Radiance fought back by entering his subjects' dreams and driving them to madness, an affliction called the Infection. In an attempt to contain the spreading Infection, the Pale King used the power of Void, a type of living darkness, to create the Vessels - beings that lack a mind and will beyond what is imprinted on them. After many attempts, he created a suitable Vessel, the Hollow Knight, and used it to contain the Infection. The Hollow Knight was placed within the Black Egg Temple and sealed by three powerful elder bugs, the Dreamers, to be locked away forever.  Depending on the player's actions, Hollow Knight has multiple endings. In the first ending, ""Hollow Knight"", the player defeats the Hollow Knight and takes its place. As chains hold the Knight in place, the Temple is sealed once again, though the Infection still survives. The second ending, ""Sealed Siblings"", occurs if the player collects the Void Heart charm before fighting the Hollow Knight. Halfway through the battle, Hornet arrives to offer assistance and briefly holds the Hollow Knight at bay. Choosing to continue fighting normally causes her to be knocked unconscious. The ending then plays out like the first, except Hornet, sealed in with the player, becomes the new Dreamer, sealing the Temple door.  The third ending, ""Dream No More"", occurs if the player collects the Void Heart and uses the Awakened Dream Nail ability to enter the Hollow Knight's mind when Hornet arrives to help. Here, the player challenges the Radiance. With the power of the Void Heart, the Knight commands the forces of the Void, with the aid of the Hollow Knight and the shades (ghosts) of the failed Vessels, to consume the Radiance, and destroy the Infection. As the darkness from the Temple fades, Hornet awakens to find the chamber empty, except for the player Knight's broken and empty shell.  "

489,Hotline Miami Collection,/wiki/Hotline_Miami_Collection,Action,Dennaton Games,Devolver Digital,Unreleased,"August 19, 2019","August 19, 2019"," Hotline Miami is divided into several chapters, each of which is further broken down into several stages. At the start of most chapters, ""Jacket"" wakes up in his apartment and listens to cryptic messages on his answering machine. These messages tell him to perform an arbitrary task at a certain location, which in each case is inferred as a euphemism for killing every person at that location (e.g., ""giving VIPs at a hotel a great stay"" or ""taking care of a pest infestation""). Prior to commencing a mission, the player is asked to select an animal mask to wear, each of which—with the exception of ""Richard"", the default rooster mask—provides a unique benefit, such as faster movement or a starting weapon.  In each stage, the player navigates a building from a top-down perspective, where the goal is almost always to kill every opponent therein. Occasionally, they must also defeat a boss at the end of the chapter or find key items as they explore. Some levels also include hidden animal masks for the player to find along the way, often in the bodies of other killers who failed the assignment now being undertaken by ""Jacket"".  By default, the player starts each assignment unarmed, just outside the target location. Most enemies carry a wide variety of melee and ranged weapons which can be collected both from their bodies and the environment. Far outnumbered, the player must rely on their increased awareness (being able to see inside every room within a large radius) and either stealth, overwhelming force or a combination of both to overcome challenges. However, because the player character is no more resilient than enemies, mistakes are often instantly fatal. Despite the game's high lethality, attacks such as punches, weapon throws and door slams merely knock enemies down, prompting the player to gruesomely execute them on the ground. In addition to the more common white suit-wearing mobsters, the player is later pitched against guard dogs, police officers and other opponents that require different strategies to defeat.  Enemy artificial intelligence varies slightly, causing them to occasionally move unpredictably and making it difficult to plan a perfect approach. To make up for this, Hotline Miami allows the player to restart each stage as soon as they die, allowing them to quickly fine-tune their approach over several attempts. At the end of each chapter, the game grades the player's performance based on factors such a speed, variation and recklessness, with high scores unlocking new weapons and additional masks.  "
490,House of the Dead,/wiki/The_House_of_the_Dead_(video_game),Rail shooter,Forever Entertainment,Sega,Unreleased,2020,2020," The House of the Dead is a rail shooter light gun game. Players use a light gun (or mouse, in the PC version) to aim and shoot at approaching zombies. The characters' pistols use magazines which hold 6 rounds; players reload by shooting away from the screen. When a player sustains damage or shoots a hostage, one point of health is removed. The continue screen appears when all health is lost. If the player runs out of continues, the game is over. First-aid packs are available throughout the game which restore one point of health; some can be obtained from rescued hostages, while others are hidden inside certain breakable objects. Special items can be found within other breakables, granting a bonus to the player who shoots them.  Throughout the course of the game, players are faced with numerous situations in which their action (or inaction) will have an effect on the direction of gameplay. This is exemplified in the opening stage of the game when a hostage is about to be thrown from the bridge to his death. If the player saves the hostage, they will enter the house directly through the front door; however, if the player fails to rescue the hostage, the character is redirected to an underground route through the sewers. If the player rescues all hostages, a secret room full of lives and bonuses is revealed toward the end of the game.  Players can score additional points by shooting enemies in the head and by rescuing hostages.   The renowned biochemist and geneticist Roy Curien becomes obsessed with discovering the nature of life and death. While supported by the DBR Corporation and its own team of scientists, Curien's behavior becomes more erratic and his experiments take a gruesome turn. The Curien Mansion in Europe, which serves as his home and laboratory, experiences an outbreak.

The two later encounter an armored, spider-like creature called The Hermit, whom they also kill to proceed.  Arriving at the mansion's laboratory, Curien unleashes his masterpiece, The Magician, a humanoid creature with pyrokinetic abilities. However, the Magician refuses to serve any master and mortally wounds his creator. Curien expresses his confusion regarding his creation's loyalty before succumbing to his injuries.

491,House of the Dead 2,/wiki/House_of_the_Dead_2,Rail shooter,Forever Entertainment,Sega,Unreleased,2020,2020," The House of the Dead 2 is a rail shooter light gun game. It includes an auto-reload feature that allows players to point their guns off-screen to reload their weapons without pulling the trigger. It also incorporates a branching path system that allows players to take a variety of different routes leading to the same point in the game's story.  The game served as the springboard for the arcade, Sega Dreamcast, and PC release The Typing of the Dead, the Nintendo DS release English of the Dead, as well as the inspiration for the Game Boy Advance game, The Pinball of the Dead.  The flashbacks to the first The House of the Dead in the game's introductory sequence were recorded using the game's engine.   The game follows the fictional events of February 26, 2000, fourteen months after the 1998 Curien Mansion incident in The House of the Dead.   AMS agent G has gone missing and his last known location is Venice, Italy. The city of Venice becomes chaotic when a strange zombie breakout takes place. American AMS agents James Taylor and Gary Stewart are dispatched, along with Amy Crystal and Harry Harris, to investigate and evacuate the populace. They suddenly encounter the impish Zeal, who had recently dealt with G. Upon finding G alive but wounded, James and Gary converse with him and G gives them a field journal showing the bosses and weak points. The pair are then met with a massive undead horde, similar to the kind from the Curien Mansion incident. They continue on, trying to save the town's civilians from the zombies.  During the chaos, James and Gary face Judgment; consisting of Zeal and his giant, headless, axe-wielding armored puppet Kuarl. After killing it, they meet up with Amy and Harry, who split up and try to meet at Sunset Bridge (or the wharf, depending on the player's actions). Upon getting there the group faces off with The Hierophant, an aquatic fishlike humanoid which heads an assault on Venice's waterways and Central Plaza. Upon defeating it, James, Gary, Amy and Harry get on a boat and continue through the rivers.  It is revealed that the zombies were created by Caleb Goldman, the man who funded Doctor Curien in making his creations during the Curien Mansion incident. It is also revealed that Goldman created the new zombies and released them into the city. Goldman leaves a message on Amy's phone, inviting them to meet him at the Colosseum. Although fearing it's a trap, the group continues on. James and Gary split up again, and face off with a group of serpents known as The Tower. After killing the mother serpent, they receive a phone call for help from Amy, before getting cut off. The two quickly race to the Colosseum only to discover Amy and a wounded Harry, injured by Strength, a giant, chainsaw-wielding zombie which wounds Harry and chases James and Gary throughout the Roman Colosseum. After they kill it, James and Gary push on, while Amy tends to Harry's wounds. They drive over to Goldman's tower, fighting Judgment, the Hierophant, and the Tower (who were revived by Goldman). They are confronted by Curien's masterpiece, The Magician, who was also revived by Goldman to oversee the birth of The Emperor, a shapeshifting crystalline entity with magnetism manipulation abilities designed to protect nature from humanity. After they defeat the Magician, they head to the top of the tower to confront the Emperor. In its prototype stage, the Emperor is not as strong as Goldman had hoped, and falls to the AMS agents. In order to evade being arrested, Goldman commits suicide by throwing himself off the roof of his building.  Players are given different endings based on the following conditions:  In the good ending, James and Gary run into Thomas Rogan, the main character from the first game, who tells them that G and Harry are all right, and that they should head off to their next battle ""as long as they have the will to live"" (in the case of James) or ""as long as there is an answer"" (in the case of Gary). In the normal ending, as James and Gary leave the building, they are greeted by G, Amy and Harry, as well as a large group of civilians, who thank them for their help. In the bad ending, James and Gary run into a zombified Goldman outside the building. As the screen goes white, a gunshot is heard.  "

494,Human Resource Machine,/wiki/Human_Resource_Machine,Puzzle,Tomorrow Corporation,Tomorrow Corporation,"June 8, 2017","March 16, 2017","March 23, 2017"," The game includes approximately 40 programming puzzles, each considered one ""year"" of the player's avatar tenure in a corporate structure. In each puzzle, the player creates a list of instructions from rudimentary commands to control the movements of their avatar on an overhead view of an office; the office includes two conveyor belts, one an inbox that sends in either an integer or a single alphabetic character represented as a small box, the other an outbox to receive these. The office floor typically also includes a number of marked number spaces that can hold one box each. For each puzzle, the player is told of a specific task, such as adding two numbers as they come in on the inbox, or sorting a zero-terminated string of characters, delivering these results in the proper order to the outbox.  The player uses simple commands to create a list of instructions to perform the given task. Such commands include picking up the first item at the inbox, placing the item the avatar is currently carrying at the outbox, copying the carried item to a marked square, performing addition or subtraction of the carried item with the item at the marked square, and making decisions based on the value of the carried item such as if it is zero or negative. As such, these mimic the elements of assembly language: the simple instructions equivalent to opcodes, the ability of the avatar to hold an item mirroring a processor register, and the spaces on the office floor representing main memory. Later, the player gains the ability to use the concept of memory addresses, in which they can direct instructions to operate on a specific floor space that is labeled with the number of a different floor space. The visual approach to the language also allows the player to place simple handdrawn notes as labels in both the list of instructions or to label floor spaces for clarity. The loops and jump commands are also marked with arrows to help the player identify the logic flow. Once they have created the program, they can run it through, increasing the speed for longer programs, or pause and move step by step for debugging purposes. If the outbox received any boxes it is not expected for that program, the program will immediately terminate and the player will need to figure out how to correct it. Though the player will be only be shown their list of instructions operation on one set of input and the expected output, the game will also test the list against other randomized sets of input and output, and will alert the player if any of these also fail. The player can receive a reminder of their puzzle task and an example of what type of output it should produce from a supervisor character that watches their avatar work, and the player can also gain hints on how to solve some programs.  Once the player has completed a puzzle, they are shown how many instructions it took and how long it took to process that program on average. Most puzzles have two challenges based on reaching or beating these two metrics; meeting both challenges may be mutually exclusive, but the player has the ability to return to any puzzle once solved to optimize it.  The game has a number of cutscenes shown after certain puzzles that show that the city that the player's avatar is working for is coming under attack by robots, who later gradually replace other workers with robots.

495,Hyper Light Drifter,/wiki/Hyper_Light_Drifter,Action role-playing,Heart Machine,Abylight,"September 6, 2018","September 6, 2018","September 6, 2018","and story  Hyper Light Drifter is a 2D action role-playing game fashioned after The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, rendered in a pixelated style comparable to Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP. The player controls the Drifter, a character that has access to technology that has long been forgotten by the inhabitants of the game's world and is suffering from an unspecified illness. The story concept was inspired by lead developer Alex Preston's heart disease, and has been likened by others to Studio Ghibli's Castle in the Sky, while Preston cites the studio's Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind as inspiration for the game's world.  The Drifter is equipped with an energy sword but can gain access to other modules that expand their weapon and ability arsenal. These often require power from rare batteries scattered around the world. Weaponry includes traditional console role-playing game archetypes, including long-range guns and area attacks. Rather than scavenging ammunition from the game world to load the player's guns, the player's ammunition instead charges when hitting enemies and objects with the energy sword. The player faces increasingly difficult monsters, both in number and ability, requiring the player to hone their tactics to succeed in the game. Preston's goal was to replicate the experience of playing on the SNES, noting that the unit had ""amazing, almost perfect games designed for limited environments"" which he challenged himself to simulate in Hyper Light Drifter. One feature of SNES games that Preston captured is that there is no spoken dialog, placing more emphasis on the game's music and visuals to tell a story.  "
497,Hyrule Warriors,/wiki/Hyrule_Warriors,Hack and slash,Omega Force,Nintendo,"March 22, 2018","May 18, 2018","May 18, 2018"," Hyrule Warriors mixes the hack and slash gameplay of Koei Tecmo's Dynasty Warriors series of video games with settings and characters from Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series. Amongst many other characters, the player controls an original iteration of Link in melee combat to take on large numbers of enemies from the Legend of Zelda series. While there is a much stronger emphasis on combat than other games in the Legend of Zelda series, the player may use common weapons from prior games in the series, such as a sword, bombs, and Link's signature spin attack. Enemy targeting also returns, in combination with elements from the Dynasty Warriors combat system. Obtaining items through discovering and opening chests is retained as well.  The game has a context-based combat system, in which the player character's abilities change depending on the weapon chosen. Role-playing elements such as weapon and character leveling also appear. Defeating certain enemies gives players weapons bags, which will grant a random weapon to the character, and materials bags, which can be used to power up characters. ""Sealed weapons"" may also be found in treasure boxes, which increase the types of weapons randomly generated for the player in the field. The game supports an asymmetric local two-player mode with one player using the Wii U GamePad and another using a monitor. The game is also compatible with Amiibo figures, with figures based on The Legend of Zelda series unlocking additional content such as new weapons.  The main campaign of Hyrule Warriors, ""Legend Mode"", allows players to progress through the game's story; these story chapters can be replayed with any character in ""Free Mode"". Additionally, the game features an ""Adventure Mode"", in which players explore a map based on that of the original The Legend of Zelda and complete specific objectives, such as defeating a certain number of enemies within a time limit or completing a mission with a specific character and weapon. An update released on the game's launch date added ""Challenge Mode"", which encourages players to collect as many rupees as possible in a set scenario. The in-game Bazaar allows players to forge new weapons, spend rupees to raise characters' levels, create potions to temporarily boost a character's stats in battle, and exchange materials for badges that augment characters' abilities. The game also offers an additional quest to collect 100 Gold Skulltulas, tokens that appear in specific Legend Mode and Adventure Mode levels after defeating enough enemies, which will unlock illustration pieces of the several characters in the game and contribute to upgrading the in-game apothecary.   The game is set in Hyrule, outside of the official Zelda timeline. Long ago, Ganondorf was defeated and his soul splintered into four fragments. Three of them were sealed in different moments in time, while the Master Sword trapped the fourth. Ganondorf plots his resurrection through Cia, a sorceress who protects the balance of the Triforce. Cia becomes fascinated with the spirit of the hero of legend, with her romantic feelings for the hero providing Ganondorf an opportunity to purge her inner light. As a result, Cia becomes consumed in her desires, opening the Gate of Souls, a portal to different time-space realities of Hyrule, to amass an army of monsters. Seeking to unite the Triforce and conquer Hyrule, she uses her subordinates Wizzro and Volga to wage war against Princess Zelda and the Hylian army.  As Cia's forces attack Hyrule Castle, Link, a Hyrulian soldier-in-training, rushes out to aid the other troops and discovers he possesses the Triforce of Courage. However, the castle is taken and Princess Zelda is unaccounted for in the aftermath, so Hyrule general Impa asks Link to aid her in finding the princess. While searching, Link and Impa meet Sheik, a Sheikah warrior who claims to know Zelda's whereabouts, and Lana, a sorceress from the same clan as Cia. The group heads to the Valley of Seers hoping to close the Gate of Souls, but Cia traps Link and Sheik, who is revealed as the bearer of the Triforce of Wisdom. Cia steals both Triforce pieces, combines them with her own Triforce of Power, and uses the completed Triforce to open portals in time and space to the resting places of Ganondorf's spirit fragments.  To restore Hyrule to normal, Link, Impa, and Lana each lead their own campaign to drive out Cia's armies and close the Gates of Souls in each era. Along the way, they are aided by each time period's native heroes, including Darunia and Princess Ruto from Ocarina of Time, Agitha and Midna from Twilight Princess, and Fi from Skyward Sword. During this time, Sheik reveals herself to be Princess Zelda in disguise, and Lana explains that she and Cia were once the same person, with Lana embodying the light Ganondorf purged from Cia's heart. Meanwhile, three of Ganondorf's spirit fragments are released, allowing for his body to be resurrected. No longer needing Cia, he attempts to take the Triforce, but Cia sends Link and Zelda's pieces back to their owners and uses her own piece to lock Ganondorf away.  After retrieving the Master Sword, whose power is strengthened by his bonds of friendship, Link prepares to confront Cia, who has been weakened after being abandoned by Wizzro and Volga and using her own life force to strengthen her troops. He defeats her and she fades away, with Lana inheriting her piece of the Triforce. Using the completed Triforce's power, the time-displaced heroes are sent back to their own periods and Hyrule is restored to normal, with Lana once again closing the Gate of Souls. However, due to the Master Sword's removal, the last of Ganondorf's spirit fragments is released, and Ganondorf is fully resurrected, summoning Ghirahim and Zant from across time and space. With their combined efforts, Ganondorf manages to retake all three Triforce pieces from their bearers, using it to strengthen his army and take over Hyrule Castle. Lana summons the heroes from Hyrule's history, and the combined group of heroes defeat Ghirahim and Zant before venturing towards Ganon's Tower. Link manages to defeat Ganondorf, but he uses the Triforce to transform himself into Beast Ganon. With the help of Zelda's light arrows, Link defeats Ganon, and the heroes use the Triforce to seal him away once more. The heroes of the past are returned, Lana resumes watching over the Triforce in Cia's place, and Link and Zelda return the Master Sword to its pedestal to prevent Ganondorf's escape.  "

Locations such as towns and dungeons are reached by navigating the game's overworld. In towns, the party can talk with villagers to reveal plot elements, and find treasure chests containing useful items. Various items such as healing potions or ""Fogstone"" items for escaping from battle are sold in shops in towns and across the world.  Enemies are represented by icons: contact with the icons initiates a battle. Battles take place in the environments where the enemy is encountered rather than shifting to a specific battle arena. Characters' health and magic meter are respectively represented by HP and MP. Characters fight using a version of the Active Time Battle System featured in games such as entries in the Final Fantasy series: after each action is taken by a character in battle, an ATB gauge must fill again before another action is taken. Available actions include attacking with weapons; using special combat abilities or magic, which are lumped together as ""Techs""; or using an item. If more than one character's ATB gauges are full, they will perform actions in the order in which instructions are issued to them.  Each character may equip ""Spritnite"" crystals on their gear. These crystals grant both passive bonuses and the abilities on the ""Techs"" menu.  Some of these Techs can synergize together into a new attack; for instance, the spinning ""Cyclone"" and rushing ""Charge"" techs can become ""X-Strike,"" a two-person attack directed at one enemy.  If one of these ""Double Techs"" are available, the ""Techs"" menu will change to ""Combo"".  Each time an action is taken, or a character's ATB gauge is allowed to remain full, a separate ""Setsuna"" gauge begins to fill.  When full, it grants a ""Momentum"" charge which may be expended at the player's discretion to grant power boosts to the character's actions. These boosts can include dealing multiple versions of the attack, recovering health, or dealing critical damage to an enemy.  "

After killing the final boss the player enters a time portal that teleports them to the first environment but with increased difficulty. Loops can be run endlessly and get more difficult each time. Loops increase the number of enemies and all the games enemies can be spawned on all environments after the first loop. The increase in difficulty also raises the number of environmental traps that can kill the player.  Killing the games bosses unlocks shrines in the games lobby that can activate curses. Curses add additional mechanics to the game that makes it more difficult.

The player can press a button at any time to switch the polarity of their ship between black and white. When white, the ship will absorb white bullets fired by enemies and store their power until released with a special attack. However, if the ship is white and hit by black bullets, it will be destroyed. The opposite is true when the ship is black. Enemy fighters also have black and white polarities. If the player ship is white and the enemy is black, the player's bullets will do twice the damage than if their ship was black. If an enemy is destroyed with the same polarity as the player, the ship will expel energy which can be absorbed or, if the player changes polarities too quickly, present a fatal danger.:9  Ikaruga does not feature any pick-ups or power-ups, instead, the player can only rely on their standard firing weapon and a homing laser. Absorbed bullets contribute to building the player's homing laser attack. The power of the attack increases one level for every 10 enemy bullets absorbed. Each level is equal to one laser, with a maximum of 12 which can be stored. A homing laser is 10 times more powerful than a standard shot.:9  The game's scoring system is based upon chaining attacks to earn bonuses. Destroying three enemy fighters of the same color in a row will earn the player a chain bonus.

The game is dark, with color used sparingly to highlight both the player and certain parts of the environment. The game is also mostly silent, with the exception of occasional musical cues, the boy's vocals, dogs barking, equipment and sound effects. The player controls the boy who walks, runs, swims, climbs, and uses objects to overcome obstacles and progress in the game. The boy gains the ability to control bodies to complete certain puzzles, a mechanic that IGN's Marty Sliva compared to a similar mechanic in The Swapper. At various points in the game, the player may discover hidden rooms containing glowing orbs. If all the orbs are deactivated during a playthrough, the player unlocks the game's alternate ending.  The boy can die in various ways, such as being shot with a tranquilizer dart, mauled by dogs, ensnared by security machines, blown apart by shockwaves, or drowned. As in the predecessor game Limbo, these deaths are presented realistically and are often graphic. If the character dies, the game continues from the most recent checkpoint.   A boy slides down a rocky incline. While running through a forest, he encounters masked guards with flashlights, as well as vehicles with mounted spotlights, and fierce guard dogs. He escapes the guards, then crosses a road where a block has been set up with more vehicles and guards, to a farm where parasitic worms cause pigs to run rampant. The boy uses the farm animals and equipment to escape to a seemingly-abandoned city where lines of zombie-like people are moved through mind control. Beyond the city is a large factory of flooded rooms, a shock wave atrium, and a laboratory environment where scientists perform underwater experiments on bodies.  While traversing these areas, the boy uses a mind-control helmet to control lifeless grey bodies, who seem to be made to work for the organization controlling the vans and dogs. The boy eventually comes across an underwater siren-like creature that attaches a device to him, allowing him to breathe underwater.  Continuing through the office and laboratories, the boy sees scientists observing a large spherical chamber. The boy enters the chamber and discovers a large blob-like creature, the Huddle, made of humanoid limbs connected to four control rods. After disconnecting the rods, the boy is pulled into the Huddle.  The Huddle escapes confinement, crashing through offices, killing some of the scientists in its path. The scientists trap the Huddle in another tank, but the Huddle escapes again and breaks through a wooden wall. It rolls down a forest hill and comes to a stop at a grassy coastline bathed in light.

515,Into the Breach,/wiki/Into_the_Breach,Turn-based strategy,Subset Games,Subset Games,Unreleased,"August 28, 2018","August 28, 2018"," Into the Breach is set in the far future where humanity fights against an army of giant monsters collectively called the Vek. To combat them, the player controls soldiers that operate giant mechs that can be equipped with a variety of weapons, armor, and other equipment. The game uses a turn-based combat system, allowing the player to coordinate the actions of their team in response to enemy moves and actions that serve to telegraph their attacks.  In combat, the player controls three different mechs against the Vek, and will be given an objective for that map along with a fixed number of turns to complete that objective. The principal goal for any map is to protect civilian structures which support the power grid that supports the mechs, but additional objectives may be presented. Should a civilian structure be damaged or destroyed, the power grid is weakened.  On each turn, Vek forces will move across the board and attack. The player is shown the direction of the Vek unit's intended attack and information on the number of moves the Vek unit is able to take and its remaining health are available on screen. The appearance of new Vek follows each turn. This gives the player the ability to then move each mech and fire one of its weapons as to either defeat the Vek unit, push the Vek off a line of attack, avoid an attack, intercept newly spawning Vek or an attack on civilian structures. Mechs can only take a limited amount of damage during battle before becoming inoperable, though a player can have a mech idle a turn to repair some damage; battle damage is otherwise completely repaired between maps. Pilots of mechs that defeat a Vek gain experience points, which can be used to unlock new skills. The gameplay of Into the Breach has been compared to that of chess, as it is less about overpowering the opposing forces and instead about maintaining position control and sacrificing units to gain a larger advantage.  Similar to FTL, the game is broken into a sequence of islands each with a number of scenarios (based on island sectors) to complete; while the islands remain the same each game, the scenarios themselves are generated procedurally in a roguelike manner. After completing the first island, the player is given the choice of which islands in the sequence to protect next; islands have various conditions that can affect combat scenarios, and more hazardous conditions can gain greater rewards from completing the scenarios on each. Should the player lose any scenario, either due to their 3 mechs becoming disabled, losing their power grid, or failing to protect a specific target for that scenario, then the player has the option to send one of the pilots back in time prior to the start of the first mission – effectively starting a new game – retaining their current experience and abilities to give an edge in the next battle. Reviewers for the website Rock Paper Shotgun described the gameplay as a mix of Pacific Rim and Edge of Tomorrow due to the time-traveling elements. Other permanent improvements, such as new pilots or sets of mechs, become available as the player completes various milestones.  "

In each playthrough, the player takes on the role of an agent handler for covert operations and has three days to prepare for their final mission. This is done by performing various missions across the globe to retrieve information, valuables, equipment and personnel, keeping cognizant of the amount of time taken for travel and missions within that three day period. The player selects two agents to perform these missions to start, and may be able to free other agents during missions; should one agent die during a mission, they remain dead for the remainder of the runthrough unless revived using a medkit consumable or dragged to the exit by another agent, while if all agents die, the game is over. The mission details and location layouts are procedurally generated for each run through, featuring a variety of objectives, obstacles, and difficulty.  Missions are played out in a turn-based manner. Each agent under the player's control has a limited number of action points each turn that allow them to move, open/close doors, take out guards silently, or perform other covert tasks. Additionally, the player may need to collect power to be able to use ""Incognita"", the hacking interface that allows them to disable alarms and security cameras or remove locks on safes. Once the player has completed their turn, any enemy forces move, and in most locations an alarm level is raised; with higher alarm levels, new security forces and threats will arrive, making the mission more difficult. Certain stations can let the player purchase upgrades or equipment for the agents to help in the mission, using collected in-game money. The objective of the mission depends on the facility type being infiltrated, usually requiring the player to retrieve a specific item from a secure location and escape, stealing as much money and equipment as possible along the way.  The game has a larger meta-game aspect, in that as they play and complete certain goals, they can unlock different agents with different skill sets or new default equipment to begin missions with in future playthroughs.   The game is set in year 2074, after megacorporations have overthrown the world's national governments and taken control. Invisible Inc. is a private intelligence agency providing services to corporations, performing infiltrations using field agents and a sophisticated AI system known as Incognita.  At the start of the game, Invisible Inc. is compromised by corporate soldiers, which leads to the headquarters as well as most agents and assets being lost, with only the agency's leader, two agents, the player, Monst3r, and Incognita escaping. Incognita can only be hosted in extremely powerful computer systems and cannot survive outside of them for more than 72 hours, so it becomes the agency's task to use that time to prepare for their final mission, where they will try to infiltrate the enemy's headquarters to access the computer system and insert Incognita.

These attacks appear, move, and attack in rhythm to the music, with difficulty increasing the further players progress.  The rhythm visually manifests on-screen as all manner of objects, of different patterns and sizes, distinguishable by their pink color, that must be dodged until the track ends. Getting struck by one of these attacks causes the player to lose part of their shape, represented by either a cyan square, a yellow triangle, a green pentagon or an orange circle, if there are multiple players. If the shape breaks entirely, the game rewinds to the previous checkpoint. Three breaks within a single level results in a Game Over screen, with the text stating ""It's Over"" and the cyan square breaking down to pieces. Tapping Enter (PC/Steam), A (Switch), or the Cross button (PS4) multiple times causes the square to fix itself and changes the screen's text to read ""It's NOT Over"", allowing the player to continue from the beginning of the level.

The player uses the two analog sticks on the DualShock controller in a manner similar to the classic arcade game Battlezone to control the direction the katamari rolls.  Other controls can be triggered by the player to gain a quick burst of speed, flip the Prince to the other side of the katamari and more.  Objects that are smaller than the katamari will stick to it when the player comes into contact with them, while greater objects can be hurdles; colliding at high speed with any may cause objects to fall off the katamari, slowing the player's progress. The game uses size, weight, and surface area to determine if an object will stick to the katamari.  This allows slender objects, such as pencils, that are longer than the katamari is wide, to be picked up, and these will alter how the katamari rolls until more objects are picked up.  Animals such as cats will chase the katamari, knocking things from it, but once the katamari is great enough, it will scare the animals away, and they can be rolled up once they are chased down. As objects stick to the katamari, the katamari will grow, eventually allowing objects that were once hurdles to be picked up, and creating access to areas that were formerly blocked.  In this manner, the player might start the game by picking up thumbtacks and ants, and slowly work up to the point where the katamari is picking up buildings, mountains, and clouds.  The typical mission given by the King of All Cosmos is the ""Make a Star"" mode, where the player needs to grow the katamari to a specific size within a given time frame. Other missions have more specific collecting rules, such as collecting as many items (swans, crabs, pairs) as possible within a given time, or collecting the largest item possible (such as a cow or bear).  The player can attempt a score attack mode for any level, in which they try to make the largest katamari possible in the time allotted.  Certain levels can unlock an ""eternal mode"" by creating an exceptionally large katamari. In eternal modes, the player can explore the level with no time limit.  Each level features two secret items that can be found. The first item is a royal present that contains an object that the Prince can wear. Most gifts are non-functional, but one includes a camera that can be used to take in-game screenshots.  The other secret item is a cousin of the Prince, which, once rolled up in main gameplay, can be used as a character in the various multiplayer modes. However, cousins can only be found and rolled up after the game is beaten. The game also tracks which objects the player has collected at any time, allowing them to review all the various objects within the game.  In the two-player mode, a player can choose to play as either the Prince or one of his numerous Cousins.  The screen is split vertically; player one on the left and player two on the right. Players compete simultaneously in a small arena to collect the most objects within three minutes. The playing field is replenished with new objects periodically. Players can ram into each other, knocking items from their opponents' katamaris, and if one player leads by a fair amount, then it is possible to roll up the opponent's katamari.  "

The player character navigates side-scrolling levels, attempting to kill all enemies in that level using his blade or environmental traps. The player character can deflect bullets with his slash, slow time with a meter that slowly refills, and dodge attacks using rolls. The game also features a real-time conversation system that the player can interrupt.   Katana Zero takes place in the dystopic, neo-noir metropolis of New Mecca.  The game's plot is heavily affected by an invasion of an unnamed Asiatic nation, referred to as the ""Cromag War,"" launched by either New Mecca or whatever controlling government rules it.  New Mecca's faction is implied to have lost the ensuing conflict.  The player controls a katana-wielding assassin called Subject Zero, as he completes various assassination contracts given to him by his psychiatrist, who also supplies him with ‘Chronos’, a drug that allows him to slow down time and predict the future.  Throughout the game, Zero experiences recurring nightmares of a child in a primitive hut; a man wearing a labcoat bursts into the hut and warns the child to hide moments before being shot dead by the menacing silhouette of a soldier.  The child is heavily implied to be a young Zero.  Zero is also repeatedly visited by Comedy and Tragedy, two men wearing lab coats and theater masks, who taunt him about impending disaster in his future.  The game begins in media res, as Zero is sent to extract a kidnapped scientist from a warehouse. The scientist is found but immediately killed by V, a Russian mobster, who escapes. His mission failed, Zero visits his psychiatrist to receive his daily Chronos injection and a dossier on his next target, Josh Rose. Zero fights his way to Rose, who commits suicide. On his way home, Zero befriends a young girl living next door to his apartment in the Third District.  Next, Zero is sent to kill DJ Electrohead, a disc jockey involved in the drug trade, and is explicitly warned not to speak to him.  Zero infiltrates his nightclub and can either kill Electrohead or listen to him confess to using Chronos before he is shot dead by an unseen sniper.  The media begins to refer to Zero's killing sprees as being the work of a serial killer known as The Dragon.  Zero's fourth target is Fa Yuan, a prison inmate. Upon arriving, Zero finds the prison staff massacred and his target already dead. SWAT officers arrive and storm the cellblock as Zero escapes. At his apartment, the Girl gives him a videotape she claims V left for him, containing a recording of V torturing and killing Zero's other neighbors.  Zero finds his psychiatrist's office closed the next morning and is picked up by V in a limousine on his way back. V offers to partner with Zero, who flatly refuses and is thrown out of the limo. He tracks V to an abandoned movie studio and fights through various film sets to reach him. Their fight is interrupted by Snow, a swordswoman working with V, who threatens Zero and leaves with V.  Beginning to experience vivid hallucinations, Zero is assigned to kill Al-Qasim, a wealthy industrialist. Zero comes upon V and his men already storming Al-Qasim's mansion and is captured. When Zero uses precognition to mock him, V shoots Al-Qasim and leaves Zero to be killed by his henchman, Mr. Kissyface. Zero kills Kissyface and chases V and his men down the highway on motorcycles. Before Zero can kill him, V is dismembered and then abducted by another swordsman, who displays similar abilities to Zero's.  Before Zero flees, the swordsman claims that he is The Dragon.  Zero suffers further hallucinations of a now-dismembered V, who claims that his visions are the result of Chronos withdrawal—without it, he will be trapped in time, unable to die. Zero's psychiatrist sends him to a Chinatown casino to hunt down The Dragon.  Within the Casino, Zero encounters The Dragon, as well as Headhunter, another Chronos user.  Zero duels Headhunter while The Dragon flees the scene; the duel ends in a draw, and Headhunter escapes.  While leaving, Zero acquires a tape containing the Prison's security footage from the night of Fa Yuan's murder. The tape footage shows The Dragon storming the prison and interrogating Fa Yuan, who tells him about Leon von Alvensleben, the creator of Chronos.  After finding the psychiatric office closed, Zero is directed to a slaughterhouse by an unknown caller.  The slaughterhouse proves to be a front for a training facility for 'NULLs', Chronos-enhanced super soldiers used by New Mecca in the Cromag war. While progressing through the facility, Zero is addressed by Alvensleben, who observes and speaks to him through a series of monitors throughout the facility.  After determining Zero was once an elite Gamma NULL, Alvensleben reveals the project was a failure, and its subjects marked for death.  Realizing that the footage of the scientist is a recording made years ago, Zero thaws the real Alvensleben from cryostasis, killing him.  Zero locates and confronts the Psychiatrist, who confirms that Zero was a NULL soldier, and that his targets have all been related to Chronos. He then sends Zero to destroy the contents of Al-Qasim's safe room in an underground bunker. At the bottom, he finds Headhunter guarding the vault.  Headhunter confirms that she is also a NULL, explaining that she is entering Chronos withdrawal, and that Al-Qasim employed her as an assassin in exchange for a supply of the drug.  Zero kills her and enters the vault, where he finds a woman and children cowering in fear. Unable to bring himself to kill them, he abandons his contract.  Zero discovers his psychiatrist preparing to flee the city, brutally beats him to death, and injects himself with a massive dose of Chronos. Alternatively, if Zero interrupts the Psychiatrist constantly during conversations and deliberately disobeys his directives during missions, the Psychiatrist becomes enraged and injects himself with an unknown drug, transforming into a monstrosity.  Zero duels the monstrosity and kills him.  Upon Zero's victory, the scene immediately cuts to him calmly seated in the office, the Psychiatrist's human self dead by a stab to the head rather than by being beaten to death.  Zero searches the Psychiatrist's belongings and leaves without visibly injecting himself with Chronos.  Returning to his apartment, he finds it burglarized, the young girl gone, and a cryptic note left behind. The landlady states that no children lived in the building. When questioned, Zero runs, and the police give chase.  Zero's recurring nightmare is replayed, minus the distortion. Zero is revealed to have been the NULL soldier responsible for shooting the Scientist, rather than the child who hid.  Having completed his objective, Zero exits the scene of the nightmare and walks over to stand next to The Dragon, who is shown to have been Zero's comrade in arms during the Cromag War.  In a mid-credits scene, Snow informs her superior of V's death at the hands of The Dragon, while The Dragon contemplates a board of evidence at a safe house. In a post-credits scene, Comedy and Tragedy taunt the little girl as she cowers in fear.  "
553,Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes,/wiki/Keep_Talking_and_Nobody_Explodes,Puzzle,Steel Crate Games,Steel Crate Games,"February 28, 2019","August 16, 2018","August 16, 2018"," The game is designed to be played with at least two players, with one player as the ""Defuser"", playing the game on a device (supporting both keyboard and mouse, touchscreen and gamepad controls, as well as support for virtual reality headsets), and the remaining players as the ""Experts"" reading the provided bomb defusal manual. As designed, the Defuser cannot look at the manual and must rely on the Experts to instruct them; similarly, the Experts cannot see the bomb, and must rely on the Defuser to describe the bomb to them. The Experts and the Defuser can communicate with each other either directly from across a table, or online using a separate voice service.  Each bomb in the game consists of multiple modules; the modules are independent of each other and can be disarmed in any order. Most modules require disarming, with the bomb successfully disarmed when all such modules are successfully disarmed. Disarming these modules requires the Defuser to relay visual indicators to the Experts, who then use the manual to determine what actions the Defuser to take. Other modules are ""needy"": they cannot be disarmed, and demand periodic attention to prevent them from causing a strike while the bomb is still armed. Each bomb will also have a countdown timer; if the timer reaches zero, the bomb will explode. Bombs will also have a maximum number of strikes resulting from errors made during defusing (also speeding the timer), and if that maximum is reached, the bomb will also explode. Other obstacles to the Defuser include the lights in the virtual room going out momentarily, and alarm clocks that will distract the Defuser.  Modules use complex instruction sets and puzzle-like elements to be solved; for example, the Experts may need to guide the Defuser through a maze whose walls the Defuser cannot see. Other modules use words that may be homophones of other similar words (""sees"" to ""seas"") or be verbal tics (""uhhh"" or ""uh huh"") that could easily be confused during communication between Defuser and Experts. Many modules have multiple stages that require the Experts to keep track of past actions as they work through each stage. Defusing some modules may also depend on the state of the bomb such as how many strikes it presently has, or external decorations on the bomb like the serial number or the presence of batteries.  The game is broken up into a number of predetermined levels broken up into skill groupings that set the number and types of modules, the time to defuse the bomb, and the maximum number of strikes. Each level will generate the bomb and its modules to be defused in a procedural manner. Players also can create a custom challenge based on module count, time, and strikes.  "

The two teams, Blue and Gold, consist of up to five players each, with one player playing as a Queen while the other players play as Drones. Drones can pick up berries found in the arena and take them to transformation gates. Gates start off unclaimed, but can be turned one team's color by a Queen. Depending on the gate, these transform a Drone into either a Speed Drone, who can move around faster, or a Warrior, who can fly and attack with a sword (or various other weapons in the Black version). Once transformed, however, Warriors lose abilities unique to Drones, such as picking up/carrying berries and riding the snail. Drones will respawn infinitely when killed, but each team's Queen only has three lives, represented by eggs in their hives.  The game features three victory conditions that teams must be cautious of: Military, Economic, and Snail. A Military Victory is achieved when the opposing team's Queen is killed three times by attacks from either the Queen or Warriors. An Economic Victory is achieved by using Drones to collect berries and place them in all the holes in their team's hive. Finally, a Snail Victory is achieved by using a Drone to ride a slow-moving snail into their team's goal. The snail will stop briefly to eat enemy Drones, but can move more quickly when ridden by a Speed Drone.  "

The player starts the game with a randomly generated king or queen on horseback. The player can move the character on horse to the left or right, including at a gallop, but has no other direct action. As the character passes landmarks, these will produce a few coins, from which the player can pick up by riding over them, and spend on various resources, which will be marked with open coin slots when the character passes near them; to purchase an upgrade, the player must be able to provide all the required coins at that time.  Initially, such resources will include hiring wandering travelers to become part of the kingdom and creating smiths to craft weapons and tools. As the player gathers more resources, new options to spend coins will open up. For example, once the player has a citizen of the kingdom with a tool, they can build defensive walls. Many such resources include upgrades that can be purchased with coins. To get more coins, the player roams their kingdom; additional landmarks will grant more coins, while servants in the kingdom can also generate coins.  While exploration of the kingdom can lead to finding more coins and potential resources, the areas away from the main kingdom center can become more dangerous for both the player-character and any followers; further, the game has a day-and-night cycle in which more harmful creatures can roam the kingdom at night, with subsequent nights becoming more and more dangerous. Other nights may have blood moons, which will cause much larger hordes of creatures to appear. These creatures will work to destroy existing resources that the player has created, steal gold from the player-character, and if the player-character has no gold, steal their crown, which represents failure in the game from which the player will need to restart the game. The player is encouraged to manage the construction of defenses and guards to manage those defenses against the need to expand and improve the kingdom. There is an ultimate goal to achieve victory, though the player must come to determine that for themselves.  "
565,Kirby Star Allies,/wiki/Kirby_Star_Allies,Platformer,HAL Laboratory,Nintendo,"March 16, 2018","March 16, 2018","March 16, 2018"," Kirby Star Allies is a 2.5D platform game played from a side-on perspective. Players control the series' titular protagonist Kirby who can be accompanied by up to three companions. Kirby can throw hearts at enemies to turn them into allies. The game can be played alone with the game's AI controlling companions or cooperatively with other players controlling companions. When Kirby has companions, new special attacks become available which allow Kirby to combine his abilities with those of his allies', a feature not seen since Kirby: Squeak Squad. The elemental fusions last for as long as the power is held or until a new element is introduced over it, while some of the combinations are single-use moves that bear more of a resemblance to the combinations found in Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards. Also, when Kirby has three allies, they can perform ""Friend Actions"" on specific stages, like ""Friend Train"" and ""Friend Star."" To fight the final boss, Kirby can use a Friend Action called the ""Star Allies Sparkler"", which resembles to the Dragoon from Kirby Air Ride. With it, Kirby can traverse around the boss in full 3D - a rarity for the series - and shoot targets of interest.  The game also introduces the ""Dream Friend"" system, which allows the player to call upon characters from past Kirby games as special allies with expanded movesets. Bandana Waddle Dee, King Dedede, and Meta Knight can all be unlocked as Dream Friends through progression in Story Mode. Additional Dream Friends have been added via software updates, including Rick, Kine and Coo (Dream Land 2); Marx (Super Star); Gooey (Dream Land 3); Adeleine & Ribbon (64); Dark Meta Knight (Amazing Mirror); Daroach (Squeak Squad); Magolor (Return to Dream Land); Taranza (Triple Deluxe); Susie (Planet Robobot); and the Three Mage-Sisters (Francisca, Flamberge, and Zan Partizanne).   On the Jambandra space station far away from Kirby's home planet, a dark crystal heart explodes due to an imperfection in a mysterious ritual, sending its numerous fragments, Jamba Hearts, hurtling into deep space. Many characters, including King Dedede and Meta Knight, are possessed while investigating the  hearts that land on Popstar. A heart hits Kirby, but it instead gives him the ability to befriend enemies by throwing hearts. Kirby notices many Waddle Dees bringing food to Castle Dedede and decides to investigate. After Kirby defeats Meta Knight and King Dedede and frees them from the Jamba Heart's influence, a large fortress known as Jambastion lands on Popstar. After defeating three generals of ice, fire, and electricity, Francisca, Flamberge, and Zan Partizanne, respectively, Kirby and his friends fly to the far reaches of space.  After defeating Francisca and Flamberge, along with other bosses, Kirby and his friends connect a path to Jambandra Base and breach its defensive barrier. They battle Zan once again before meeting Hyness, an evil priest who is planning to restore a dark force, Void Termina, to full power using the Jamba Hearts. Defeating Hyness reveals his true face, a blue large-nosed figure with twitching eyes. He summons Francisca, Flamberge, and Zan Partizanne and uses dark energy to strengthen them and drain their life force. After being defeated, Hyness sacrifices the three and himself to subsequently revive Void Termina. Kirby and his friends use a Friend Pedestal to summon the Friend Star but it transforms into the Star Allies Sparkler via the power of the four heart pins that were stuck in the prison of Void Termina. After overcoming its humanoid body, also regurgitating Hyness, Francisca, Flamberge, and Zan Partizanne in the process, and defeating its bird form, it is revealed that its true form is a purplish pink cluster with three dark eye-like spots that can arrange themselves to resemble Kirby's face. During battle, this blob morphs into different shapes that reference Dark Matter from Kirby's Dream Land 2 and 02 from Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards. Kirby then destroys Void Termina with the Star Allies Sparkler, summoning friends in the process. The Sparkler is destroyed by the resulting explosion, but Kirby uses a Warp Star to return himself and his friends safely home.  "

Noire is an action-adventure neo-noir crime game played from a third-person perspective. The player completes cases—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the story. The game also features a mode which allows the player to freely roam the open world and engage in optional activities. The world features multiple landmarks, which are all based on real monuments from 1940s Los Angeles.  The game takes place in the city of Los Angeles, in the year 1947, with the player assuming the role of Los Angeles Police Department officer, and later detective, Cole Phelps. The game starts with Phelps as a uniformed patrolman, and follows his career as he advances through the police department bureaus (desks) of Traffic, Homicide, Vice and Arson. Each desk gives the player a new partner who will help Phelps in his investigation of a number of cases based on a specific type of crime. The game assigns the player with cases that they must solve. After each case, the player receives a rating of 1–5 stars depending on their performance in both interrogations and searching for clues. In some cases, when searching an area for clues to the crime, the player can also find newspapers. Besides reading the story, the newspapers give access to a short cinematic that either covers a part of the game's overarching plot or a flashback to Phelps's war memories. Near the end of the final desk, the player assumes control of private investigator Jack Kelso, who becomes the player character for most of the remaining cases; although different in appearance and personality, his controls are identical to Phelps.  The game blends investigative elements with fast-paced action sequences, including chases, combat, interrogations and gunfights. The player character uses melee attacks and firearms to fight enemies, and may run, jump or use vehicles to navigate the world. In combat, auto-aim and a cover system can be used as assistance against enemies. Should player characters take damage, the character's health will gradually regenerate. Weapons can only be used in appropriate circumstances, such as during firefights. When driving vehicles, the player has the option to skip directly to the destination by nominating their partner as the driver. The player can also ask the partner for directions. In addition to storyline cases, the player may engage in optional side investigations, known as Street Crimes, that are not related to the case that they are working on. Some street crimes will feature characters from previous cases.  Suspects and witnesses in a case can be interrogated for information. When the interviewee responds, the player is given the option to either believe them, doubt them, or accuse them of lying. If the player accuses them of lying, they must submit evidence to prove it. When interrogating two suspects at the police station, the player may decide whom to charge with the crime; charging the wrong suspect affects the player's end rating. The player is presented with the option to skip past an action sequence and continue through the narrative if they fail it three times. There is also a free roam mode called ""The Streets of L.A."", which is unlocked after each crime desk is completed, except for the Patrol desk. In this mode, the player and his partner are allowed to freely roam the city of Los Angeles. The player can replay Street Crimes, find Golden Film Reels, discover Landmarks, collect Hidden Vehicles, find Badges or just cruise around and listen to the radio.   Following the end of World War II, Cole Phelps (Aaron Staton), a decorated United States Marine Corps veteran, returns to Los Angeles and works as a patrol officer of the LAPD. In 1947, after successfully solving a major murder case and being promoted to detective, Phelps earns a reputation over the next six months for solving difficult cases for both the Traffic and Homicide divisions; he most notably concludes the Black Dahlia case.  Upon being promoted into the Vice division, he becomes involved in the investigation into military surplus morphine syrettes being sold on the street, stolen from the ship that had brought home his former Marine unit. He learns that several members of his former unit had stolen and distributed the morphine, only for them to be assassinated on the orders of Mickey Cohen (Patrick Fischler), who controlled the city's drug trade. During this time, Phelps falls for German lounge singer Elsa Lichtmann (Erika Heynatz) and has an affair with her.  Roy Earle (Adam J. Harrington), Phelps's partner in Vice and a corrupt cop, helps several prominent figures in the city draw attention away from a major prostitution scandal by exposing Phelps's adultery before he is able to draw a confession from Courtney Sheldon (Chad Todhunter), a member of Phelps's former unit, over his involvement with the stolen morphine. In exchange, Earle is given a place in a syndicate known as the Suburban Redevelopment Fund (SRF)—a program founded under the pretense of providing affordable housing for returning veterans. Phelps's marriage ends, he becomes disgraced in the LAPD, and he is demoted to the Arson desk, where he is tasked with investigating a number of suspicious house fires. Despite noting a strong connection between them and a housing development that the SRF operates, Phelps is warned off by Earle from pursuing the syndicate and its founder, tycoon developer Leland Monroe (John Noble). Seeking help, Phelps prompts an old comrade, Jack Kelso (Gil McKinney), now an investigator for the California Fire & Life Insurance Company, to look into the matter.  Kelso discovers that the development is using unsuitable building materials and that his boss Curtis Benson (Jim Abele), a member of the SRF, is insuring them despite this fact. Following a shootout at Monroe's mansion, Kelso learns that the syndicate used a patient of prominent psychiatrist Harlan Fontaine (Peter Blomquist), a member of the SRF, to burn down the homes of those who would not agree to sell their property to the fund; eventually, his patient accidentally killed four people in one such fire and became irreversibly traumatised. Confronting Fontaine at his clinic, the patient murders Fontaine and kidnaps Elsa.  Investigating Fontaine's clinic, Phelps discovers that the syndicate was a front to defraud the US Federal Government: Monroe would acquire land with money invested by the syndicate and build surreptitiously cheap houses on them to increase their value, knowing the government would later purchase the plots through eminent domain to make space for a new freeway. Phelps also discovers that Sheldon, overcome with guilt, had provided Fontaine with the stolen morphine under the pretense that Fontaine would legally provide the morphine to medical facilities with the profits being reinvested into the SRF; Sheldon was later murdered by Fontaine after gaining knowledge of Kelso's investigation into the SRF. Kelso realises that Fontaine's patient was Ira Hogeboom (J. Marvin Campbell), a former flamethrower operator from his and Phelps' unit who became severely traumatised after unintentionally burning out a cave of civilians on Phelps's orders. Phelps and Kelso pursue Hogeboom and Elsa into the Los Angeles River Tunnels. The pair rescue Elsa, and Kelso executes the incapacitated Hogeboom to end his suffering. As the water rises within the tunnels following intense rainfall, the group attempts to escape, but Phelps is unable to reach the exit and drowns.  A funeral is held for Phelps. As Earle delivers a eulogy for Phelps, Elsa leaves in disgust. Herschel Biggs (Keith Szarabajka), Phelps's Arson partner, tells Kelso that while Kelso and Phelps were never friends, they were not enemies either. In a closing epilogue flashback, Kelso is revealed to have known about the stolen morphine but refused to be involved in its distribution, knowing the trouble it would cause.  "

Many powerups will allow the player to reach new areas, but the game gives no indication of where to go.  Since the game was intended as a tribute to the MSX games of the 1980s (and especially to Maze of Galious), it uses the 16-color palette and low resolution typical of those games. The opening sequence parodies the typical load screen of the MSX, displaying the amount of available video RAM and a copy of the MSX logo. The protagonist has a laptop MSX in his possession throughout the game, and can collect or buy ROM cartridges for it; many of these can be combined to produce various special effects.  Initially, the protagonist is equipped with a whip, and has a small amount of vitality. Items in the game help advance the plot, some of which do not grant any abilities, but open up a new area or allow another item to be taken. Other items, however, do grant the protagonist abilities, and some are required to access new areas of the game.  Most non-boss enemies in the game will not cause a lot of damage to the protagonist, however there are very few ways to restore life, and in many cases getting hit will cause the protagonist to fall off a hard-to-reach ledge and lose progress. An item in the game is available early on that enables teleportation back to the start (the location of the game's only save point) in addition to various waypoints. As explained in the game's manual, the general strategy of the game is to explore and solve as many puzzles as possible before getting low on life and teleport back when the risk of death becomes too great.  However, actions taken in certain rooms can make it very difficult to return after warping out, so warping out is not always the wise action.  One of the principles behind the game's design is difficulty: as described in the game's manual, the developers were disappointed in the lack of difficulty prevalent among many games, and sought to help create a sense of tension in the game—the example they gave was that, if one were a real-life archaeologist, one might think twice before jumping into a dark pit, but in many videogames, it is too easy to simply attempt the action, suffer the consequences, and reload. The tension is created by arming many features in the game with various traps that can easily befall reckless adventurers, as well as several complete dead ends, from which, short of teleportation, there is no way out. The game explains these traps as existing in order to protect the sacred ruins.   Lemeza Kosugi, a professor of archaeology, receives a letter from his father Shorn Kosugi, who claims he has discovered the ruins of La-Mulana, supposedly the birthplace of all civilizations and carries the secret treasure of life itself. Following his father's trail, Lemeza comes to the ruins and discovers it is composed of various amalgamations of various ruins and structures from different areas around the globe. Upon further exploration and discovery within the ruins, Lemeza learns the story about how a being known as ""the Mother"" fell down from the sky and crashed onto the planet. The Mother has sought to return to space where it came from. To this end, she created various ""children"" which were different races that roamed the planet that she tasked to find a way to send her back to the sky. None of them could figure out a way to accomplish this task, which angered the Mother greatly and would destroy them in her rage, to start over again with a new race.  The people of the seventh generation of children came to the conclusion that it was impossible to bring the Mother back to the sky; it turns out the entire ruins of La Mulana is actually the Mother's body. They decided the best course of action before their race was killed off was to grant the Mother a merciful death. To this end, they made it so that the children of the eighth civilization would grow without knowledge of the Mother so they could have the will and power to accomplish such a task. This eight generation would end up becoming humanity. To accomplish this task, Lemeza has to draw out the Mother's soul and bestow it a physical form to destroy. Through a grueling battle, Lemeza manages to accomplish this before Mother can enact her plan to bring forth the ninth generation. Taking the secret treasure of life after defeating the Mother, Lemeza escapes the crumbling ruins to the surface before it collapses on him. Upon his return to the surface, Shorn surprises him from behind and steals the treasure for his own, leading Lemeza to chase after his father into the coming sunrise.  "

On the App Store, it is described as a ""plate"". In game, it is referred to as the ""Notalium Tuner"". The player must tap(click), hold(catch), slide(rail), or flick the notes when they reach the outer ring of the circle in accordance to the beat. The plate changes sizes, spins, or moves around the screen in the middle of gameplay and the player must re-adjust themselves accordingly. Items will be picked up and stored as the player experiences the story. The story and items can be looked at by accessing the menu, which also includes options to customize the game interface. The player has the option to turn off background effects, change timing offset, tuner transparency, and tap note volume.   According to the official site, the game takes place in a world similar to the real world until a calamitous disaster called ""Al Niente"" occurred long ago, rendering the majority of the earth devoid of sound and color. Areas are able to retain their color only by being near ordered ""Notalium"", an artificially created crystalline energy source left behind by ancient predecessors. The process of creating Notalium is currently forgotten; all Notalium is provided by the Notalium Administration.

One day, Carl touches one of June's paintings of people who had been present on the day of the accident and discovers that he can revisit their past memories. As Carl relives their memories, the characters can perform actions that change the sequence of events that led up to June's death. Carl manages to prevent the initial accident, but another event causes the car crash. He continues to change events multiple times, but each attempt still results in the accident by different circumstances. In the finale of the game, Carl realizes that he cannot change that someone dies that day, so he switches places with June, sacrificing himself instead, saving her and their unborn child. However, shortly before the end of the game, Carl finds a sketchbook made by June which lists attempts by her to save him, rather than the other way around.  Nate Hohl of All Gamers proposes instead that wheelchair-bound Carl is June's fantasy and manifestation of grief, while the game's final revelation is her recovery.   Last Day of June is an adventure puzzle video game in third-person perspective. The player initially controls Carl who is on a date with June on the day leading up to their accident. Afterwards, the player controls Carl in their home at a later date and discovers that they can interact with June's paintings. This allows the player to take control of various characters from the day of the accident in an attempt to solve puzzles to alter the sequence of events that indirectly caused the accident. As the player fails to prevent June's death, new paintings and characters are unlocked to allow for an increasingly complex sequence of changes.  "
578,The Last Door,/wiki/The_Last_Door,Adventure,The Game Kitchen,Plug In Digital,Unreleased,"May 23, 2019","May 22, 2019"," As a point-and-click adventure, the player controls the character, moves him through various locations, picks up and uses items to move the story forward, and solves puzzles. Red herrings are rare, with each item generally having a single use. Episodes start out with a number of locked areas, which can be unlocked by finding keys and using other items to expand the explorable world. In episodes 1, 2, and 3 of the Season 2 a larger, map based world was introduced, giving players the ability to open a map to travel to different regions or areas of the overall map, and then being able to explore the area selected on foot. This feature is absent in the final instalment of Season Two, ""Beyond the Curtain.""   From here, the game has at least two alternate endings. Wakefield can either travel through the curtain, or he can let the curtain close. Each triggers a unique ending to the game. If the player goes through the curtain, Wakefield sacrifices himself and takes Devitt's place. He stays behind to close The Last Door and is killed. Devitt then finds himself in a London street, where he returns home and burns evidence. If the player lets the curtain close, then Devitt is killed as he closes the Last Door. After closing it, Wakefield is transported to a London street and he finds his way home, before burning all remnants of his journey through the Veil. In both endings, the surviving characters makes a pact to ""see that no one knows,"" reflecting the Playwright's motto, videte ne quis sciat. Additionally, both endings also feature those members of the Playwright who were in the Veil (including Alexandre) becoming trapped in the Veil, essentially rendering them nonexistent.  "
579,The Last Remnant Remastered,/wiki/The_Last_Remnant_Remastered,Role-playing,Square Enix,Square Enix,"June 11, 2019","June 10, 2019","June 11, 2019"," The game is split between a world area, a battle area and a world map. The player controls Rush Sykes, the protagonist, and moves him around the world screen within an area, with the camera floating behind and slightly above him. Within the world screen, the player can talk to anyone, enter buildings and other areas, or exit to the map screen. The map screen allows instant travel between different cities and areas, or between different areas within the city. On the battle screen, the game has a three-dimensional area like the world screen with a setting reminiscent of the location, where every character and enemy appear. Instead of random encounters, players enter the separated battle when they touch an enemy on the main world screen. The player may choose to enter a battle with multiple enemies at once by activating a ""time-shift"" system, in which time slows down and they may run up to multiple enemies before the battle.  The game features a battle system labeled by Hiroshi Takai as a ""turn-based, command-based system using symbol encounters"". During a battle, each enemy from the world screen is represented by a group, or ""union"", of enemies ranging from one to five individual units; similarly the player's forces are composed of multiple unions of three to five units each. The skills of the units in the player's unions, which include both story characters and hireable units not appearing outside of battle, vary according to different parameters. One such parameter is the ""morale"" bar, which is affected by the events in battle and can have positive or negative effects on the battle forces. Each unit can also learn different attacks, which are divided into categories such as blade attacks and healing magic. At the beginning of each turn the player selects from a group of choices what attack types each union will perform; the player is unable to select the individual attack of each unit. Special attacks require ""action points"", which continually accrue during each battle. The player selects at the beginning of each turn which enemy union each of their unions will attack. As the enemy makes their selections at the same time, it is possible for a union to be ""deadlocked"", or forced to fight a different union than the player or enemy had selected. When multiple unions are deadlocked onto the same enemy, some of the unions can flank the enemy or attack from the rear for extra damage.  In addition to battles, the player can take on a number of quests. Many of these take the player to an area immediately upon acceptance and return them once completed, while ""guild quests"" do not require acceptance and may be turned in by the player whenever the accomplishments listed in the quest are completed. Rush and other units may equip many different weapons and items. Rush's equipment can be upgraded to many different options, while other units request materials for their own, which can be purchased at stores, acquired in battles, or found in areas using a creature called Mr. Diggs. He can upgrade abilities to enable him and find any types of materials.   "

The same day Katrielle and her assistant Ernest Greeves meet a talking dog that, for reasons unknown, cannot be understood by anyone else but them. The dog explains that he has amnesia, and that he wishes for them to solve the mystery of who he really is, and Katrielle creates the name Sherl O.C Kholmes for him.  After solving the case of the disappearance of one of Big Ben's hour hands at the request of Inspector Hastings of Scotland Yard, Katrielle, Ernest and Sherl investigate and solve several other cases, most of them related to the ""Seven Dragons"", seven of the most rich and influential figures of London, with assistance of Hastings and Emiliana Perfetti, one of the Yard's profilers. Other cases include Hastings' request to look for a present to his wife on a holiday and solve a murder that Katrielle was wrongly accused of committing. In one occasion, Ernest also tells Sherl the story of how he and Katrielle met, when he was falsely accused of theft and she helped clear his name as well.  In the final case of the game, Layton and the Seven Dragons are invited by the mysterious Lord Adamas to the abandoned mansion of Maximilian Richmond, a millionaire who died 10 years before. In the occasion, Adamas forces the Seven Dragons to sign a contract where they relinquish all their fortunes to him should they fail to solve a series of puzzles, or he will reveal a grave secret about them. Attending the event at Layton's stead, Katrielle accepts Adamas' request to oversee the dispute. All of the Dragons fail to solve the puzzles and accept defeat, until Katrielle discovers that Lord Adamas is no other than Ernest, whose true identity is Miles Richmond, Maximilian's grandson, who grew up with the false assumption that the Dragons betrayed and ruined their family, swearing to enact revenge on them.  After the misunderstanding is cleared, Ernest reconciles with the Dragons and accepts Katrielle's request to keep working as her assistant. In the post-credits, Katrielle renews her vow to unlock the mystery of Sherl's true identity and discover the whereabouts of her father. Although she is no closer with the latter, she proclaims that she has solved the puzzle that her father left behind when he disappeared: ""If you're not really my child, then who exactly are you?"".

587,Legend of Kay,/wiki/Legend_of_Kay,Action-adventure,Kaiko,THQ Nordic,Unreleased,"May 29, 2018","May 29, 2018"," For many generations, the mystical land of Yenching had been inhabited by many animals, mainly cats, hares, frogs, and pandas. Because of a religious code called the Way, these four races had prospered throughout the ages in their own separate towns. But as the years passed, the younger generations began to defect from the Way. Ultimately, with no protective code to guide the races, Yenching was invaded by the Gorillas and the Rats (known as the Din), led by Gorilla Minister Shun and Tak, the Rat Alchemist. Minister Shun now rules the majority of Yenching with an iron fist, and is said to reside in the volcanic mountain of Waa-Lo.  The story now focuses around a figure named Kay. Kay is a hotheaded young cat, and the Master's finest martial arts student. Like many of the people of the races, Kay does not believe in the Way, and likes to focus on physical skills and strength. This is what makes his friend, Su Ling, leave his town in disgust, hoping to find another town that would share her belief in resurrecting the Way. One day, in Kay's martial arts school, Shun's gorillas and the mayor of Kay's town declare that they must shut down the school because new 'Din schools' must soon be erected in the town. Kay is outraged, and even more so when his Master simply agrees to the new terms. And so, making up his mind, Kay sneaks into his Master's house at night (the Master is drunk, and asleep) and steals the mystical blade the Master keeps. Kay then jumps out of the town walls, and makes his way into the wilderness.  Kay's exploits vary from traversing to the Haretree (the secret residence of all the hares of Yenching), befriending a dragon (and almost getting fried in the process), traveling through dangerous swamps in order to reach Frog City (the city of frogs, obviously), and riding on a dragon to get to the Forbidden City (the city of pandas, located on a plateau), all the while defeating hordes of rats, crocodiles, turtles, bears, ladybugs, and gorillas. There, in the  Forbidden City, Kay finds his friend Su Ling, who is now a ringleader of the Avalanche, a group of pandas who are dedicated to the revival of the Way, and stopping Shun and the army of Din. After helping them out, the Avalanche begins its voyage to island of Waa-Lo, with Kay in tow. After an arduous voyage, Kay and the Avalanche begin to explore the caves of Waa-Lo, making their way to the center of the volcano. During the expedition, Kay finally catches up with Tak, the rat alchemist. After defeating him, Kay meets Shun in person. The two engage in a fierce duel, with Kay being the victor. Injured, Shun runs to the contraption he and Tak created. The fires of Waa-Lo power up the machine, and begin to fuse Shun and one of his bodyguards into a single, monstrous ape-like entity. With no choice left but to fight, Kay begins to do battle with the monster. As Kay strikes the final blow, Waa-Lo begins to erupt. Luckily, the Avalanche sends a rescue team, via a hot-air balloon.  As Kay, Su Ling, and the Avalanche (all back in the ship) stare across the horizon at the exploding volcano, the merchant (who the pandas have seemingly saved) tries to sell some souvenirs to Kay and Su Ling. With a grin, Kay pulls off the merchant's rice hat to reveal the Master himself. Kay jokes about finally having to master his abilities by outfoxing his master. Kay, Su Ling, and the Master all then begin to laugh, the ship returning for a free Yenching.  "
588,The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild,/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_Breath_of_the_Wild,Action-adventure,Nintendo EPD,Nintendo,"March 3, 2017","March 3, 2017","March 3, 2017"," Breath of the Wild is an action-adventure game set in an open world where players are tasked with exploring the kingdom of Hyrule while controlling Link. In terms of structure, Breath of the Wild encourages nonlinear gameplay, which is illustrated by the game's lack of defined entrances or exits to areas, scant instruction given to the player, and encouragement to explore freely. Breath of the Wild introduces a consistent physics engine to the Zelda series, letting players approach problems in different ways rather than trying to find a single solution. The game also integrates a ""chemistry engine"" that defines the physical properties of most objects and governs how they interact with the player and one another. For example, players may take advantage of the game's dynamic weather by throwing metal objects at enemies during thunderstorms to attract a lightning strike. However, the level of realism offered in the ""chemistry engine"" also means that players will equally attract an unavoidable fatal lightning strike if wearing any metal during thunderstorms. These design approaches result in a generally unstructured and interactive world that rewards experimentation and allows for nonlinear completion of the story.  As Link, players can perform actions such as running, climbing, swimming, and gliding with a paraglider, although Link is limited by his stamina. Link can procure items from the environment, including weapons, food, and other resources. Unlike previous Zelda games, weapons and shields will degrade over time. Many items have multiple uses; for example, wooden weapons and armor can be set to light fires or collect incoming enemy arrows, and shields can be used as makeshift snowboards. Players can obtain food from hunting animals, gathering wild fruit, or collecting parts of defeated enemies. By cooking combinations of food or materials, the player can create meals and elixirs that can replenish Link's health and stamina, or provide temporary status bonuses such as increased strength or weather resistance. An important tool in Link's arsenal is the ""Sheikah Slate"", which can be used to mark waypoints on a map and as an in-game camera. Over the course of the game, Link can collect powers to add to the Slate, including the abilities to create remote bombs, manipulate metal objects, form ice blocks on watery surfaces, and temporarily stop objects in time. In combat, players can lock onto targets for more precise attacks, while certain button combinations allow for advanced offensive and defensive moves. Players may also defeat enemies without weapons, such as by rolling boulders off cliffs into enemy camps.  Besides exploration, players can undergo quests or challenges to obtain certain benefits. Activating towers and shrines adds waypoints that the player may warp to at any time. Activating towers also adds territories to the map, although location names are not added until the player explores that area. Dotted throughout Hyrule are shrines that contain challenges ranging from puzzles to battles against robotic opponents. Clearing shrines earns Spirit Orbs, which can be traded for additional health or stamina points. Scattered across Hyrule are small puzzles that reveal Korok Seeds, which can be traded to expand inventory size for weapons, shields, and bows. Towns serve as hotspots for quests, sidequests, and shops selling materials and clothing. Hikers and other travelers offer sidequests, hints, or conversation. Additionally, players can scan Amiibo figures against their console to summon items or call Link's horse Epona from previous Zelda games and Wolf Link from Twilight Princess.   Breath of the Wild takes place at the end of the Zelda timeline in the kingdom of Hyrule. 10,000 years before the beginning of the game, the evil Calamity Ganon threatens Hyrule, but he is defeated by a princess with the blood of the goddess and with the help of her appointed knight.  Hyrule matured into an advanced civilization, protected by four enormous animalistic machines called the Divine Beasts and an army of autonomous weapons called Guardians. Upon Ganon's return, four great warriors were given the title of Champion, and each piloted one of the Divine Beasts to weaken Ganon while the princess and knight fought him so she could seal him away.  9,900 years later, the kingdom of Hyrule had devolved to a medieval state. Reading their ancestors' prophecies, the Hylians recognized the signs of Ganon's return and excavated the Divine Beasts and Guardians. During this time, Zelda trained vigorously to awaken the sealing magic needed to defeat Ganon. The champions of Hyrule's races—Daruk, warrior of the mountainous Goron; Mipha, princess of the aquatic Zora; Revali, archer of the birdlike Rito; and Urbosa, chief of the desert-dwelling Gerudo—assembled to pilot the Divine Beasts (Vah Rudania, Vah Ruta, Vah Medoh, and Vah Naboris respectively,) while the current Zelda and Link battled Ganon. However, Ganon possessed the Guardians and Divine Beasts, turning them against Hyrule. King Rhoam and the Champions were killed, the castle town was destroyed, and Link was gravely wounded. Zelda took Link to safety, hid the Master Sword, and used her magic to trap Ganon in Hyrule Castle.  100 years after that, an amnesiac Link awakens in Hyrule. He meets an old man, who reveals himself as the spirit of King Rhoam. Rhoam explains that Ganon, sealed in Hyrule Castle, has grown strong; he pleads for Link to defeat Ganon before he breaks free and destroys the world.  Link travels across Hyrule, returning to locations from his past and regaining his memories. With the help of the Hyrulean races, he boards the four Divine Beasts and purges them of Ganon's monsters, releasing the spirits of Hyrule's former champions and allowing them to pilot the Divine Beasts once again. After obtaining the Master Sword from the Lost Woods, Link enters Hyrule Castle and defeats Ganon with the help of the Divine Beasts and Zelda's Bow of Light. Zelda seals Ganon away, restoring peace and allowing the spirits of King Rhoam and the champions to depart. Sensing their presence, Link and Zelda smile fondly.  If players fulfill certain conditions (freeing all four Divine Beasts, retrieving the Master Sword, and finding all memories), they unlock a secret ending in which Zelda realizes that Hyrule must be rebuilt and that she and Link must begin the process themselves. As Link and Zelda survey Hyrule and embark to rebuild their world, the princess confides that she may no longer possess any supernatural power, yet still she is happy.  "

Chase goes on the hunt for criminals, with various moves at his disposal, such as swinging across poles and performing wall jumps. He can also gain disguises that give him additional abilities, such as a robber disguise that lets him break locks. Chase can also pilot vehicles, such as cars and helicopters, and use loose bricks to build various objects. Other characters can be playable once unlocked, but they'll still talk with Chase's voice (except in cut-scenes where Chase can still be seen). Custom characters are also playable. The Wii U GamePad can be used as a device including a communicator and as a scanner to locate criminals.  Lego City Undercover's gameplay borrows heavily from the Grand Theft Auto series. However the game is role-reversed with the player taking on the role of a police officer enforcing the law, rather than a criminal committing crime, although the player is required to commit criminal acts on some occasions in order to infiltrate criminal gangs.   In 2011, Police officer Chase McCain (Joseph May) comes back to Lego City, after being sent away two years ago in the aftermath of an important case, at the request of Mayor Gleeson. Upon his return, Gleeson reveals the city is in the grips of a crime wave, which she suspects to be the work of Rex Fury - a notorious criminal that Chase helped to arrest, who had recently escaped from prison - and asks Chase to find him and stop him once again. To assist him in his work, Chase is joined by dim-witted rookie Frank Honey, and assisted by police technician Ellie Phillips, though his return is not welcome news for Natalia Kowalski (Jules de Jongh), Chase's ex-girlfriend, who was forced into the witness protection program after he inadvertently revealed her as the witness in Fury's trial, nor Marion Dunby (Kerry Shale), the city's new Chief of Police, who had Chase sent away because of his mistake as well as always having a giant dislike to him.

Following the recent capture of an individual (dubbed ""The Rookie""), Commissioner Gordon oversees their transfer to Stryker's Island in Metropolis. As the Rookie has developed an ability to absorb superpowers, Gordon offers the incarcerated Lex Luthor a reduced prison sentence in exchange for monitoring them and assessing their potential threat. Mercy Graves arrives and helps break Luthor and the Rookie out, alongside several other imprisoned villains, with the Justice League in pursuit. Meanwhile, the Joker and Harley Quinn steal several items from Wayne Tech, with Batman giving chase. The combined group of villains defeated by the sudden arrival of the ""Justice Syndicate"", a superhero team from Earth-3, with only a few escaping. Before departing, Harley witnesses the Syndicate forcibly warp the Justice League away.  The Syndicate claim that the Justice League are on an off-world mission, becoming their new replacements, with leader Ultraman posing as reporter Kent Clarkson to feed false information to the public. Suspicious of the Syndicate, Luthor begins uniting a massive force of villains to expose the truth and defeat the Syndicate so that they might take over. During their research, the villains discover the Justice Syndicate is actually the ""Crime Syndicate"", a group of Earth-3's greatest criminals, and that they are searching for something on Earth, using their superhero personas to gain easy access to classified information and locations. Once a large enough group has been assembled, the united Legion of Doom launch an attack on the Crime Syndicate on top of LexCorp, but Luthor betrays everyone, planning to use the Syndicate's technology to be rid of them all in order to rule the Earth alone. Luthor successfully teleports everyone away, but inadvertently brings Apokolips near to Earth.  As the Syndicate tries to maintain order, Joker, Harley and the Rookie wake up on Apokolips and find themselves encountering Darkseid, the Syndicate's secret master, who ordered them to search Earth for the last piece of the Anti-Life Equation. As Darkseid discovers them, the Justice League show up, having just escaped their imprisonment on Apokolips. Escaping Darkseid's forces, they discover the Syndicate has fooled the people of Earth into believing the Justice League have become evil, prompting them to form an alliance with the Legion of Doom to stop them.  After gathering more forces, the alliance tricks Johnny Quick into revealing the Syndicate's plans on live television, turning the public against them. Upon defeating and sending the Syndicate back to Earth-3, the alliance focus on finding the last piece of the Equation. Batman soon discovers it to have been inside a Mother Box Harley stole from Wayne Tech, until the Rookie inadvertently absorbed it while sending the Crime Syndicate back to their Earth. Learning that Darkseid is sending his forces to Earth to track it down, the alliance attempts to protect the Rookie, but they are captured and taken to Apokolips, forcing the League and the Legion to mount a rescue mission. Though the Rookie is rescued, Darkseid absorbs the last piece of the Equation. However, it proves ineffective as the Rookie's physiology caused it to be altered, having actually hailed from Earth-3. The Rookie then uses the Anti-Life Equation to turn Darkseid and his forces good. Though Luthor attempts to abandon them again and take over Earth, the alliance manages to restore Apokolips to its original location and return home. The Rookie is given the choice of joining the Justice League as a superhero, or continue working for the Legion of Doom as a supervillain.  In a post-credits scene, the Anti-Monitor arrives on Apokolips and, disgusted by Darkseid's kindness, attacks him.  "

The game allows the player to control various super-heroes and villains alike from both films (including supers that have appeared in neither film but are listed in the National Supers Agency database in the special features of The Incredibles' DVD release), each with their own special abilities and superpowers. For example, Mr. Incredible has super-strength and invulnerability, Elasti-Girl can shape her body in many ways, Violet can turn invisible and create force fields, Dash can run at incredible speeds, and Jack-Jack has a large variety of powers, just like in the films, such as turning into a human torch, telekinesis and teleportation, to name a few. The game also includes various characters from other Pixar films, such as Flik from A Bug's Life,  Merida from Brave, Lightning McQueen from Cars and Woody from Toy Story.  The open-world of the game is set in two fictional cities, Municiberg and New Urbem, which are situated very close to each other. Apart from the typical gold bricks puzzles, quests and challenges, the game adds a new feature called the Crime Wave, where the player travels to a specific area of one of the cities which is under assault from a super-villain and their minions. The player must complete all the quests given by the people in the area to complete the Crime Wave. Usually, the final quest involves defeating the super-villain. There are ten Crime Waves in total and five super-villains to defeat: three from the films (Bomb Voyage, the Underminer, and Syndrome) and two original characters, exclusive to the game (the Brainfreezer and Anchor-Man).  The game also has a complex character customiser similar to the one from Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2. It is located inside Edna Mode's home.   The game's story closely follows the plot of both The Incredibles and Incredibles 2, though with numerous humorous deviations. There are also several major changes to both films' storylines, such as Mr. Incredible being aided by Frozone in fighting the first Omnidroid on the Nomanisan island, or Syndrome being simply defeated when Jack Jack's power activate rather than dying after being sucked into his jet's engine. Players go through the second film's campaign entirely, before returning to that of the first film.  "

The game features 20 levels, with five levels based on each film. The levels are accessed through a free-roaming overworld area. The game incorporates a two-player cooperation mode. The game features more than 100 unlockable characters to play as, including more than 20 dinosaur species, such as Ankylosaurus, Stegosaurus, Triceratops and Tyrannosaurus. Mr. DNA, a cartoon character featured in the 1993 Jurassic Park film, is also an unlockable character. Throughout the game, Mr. DNA provides the player with hints; and with dinosaur trivia, as he did in the Jurassic Park video game for the Super NES.  Human characters include Dr. Alan Grant, Ian Malcolm, and Owen Grady. Each character has a special ability. The utilization of each character's ability is required to progress through the game. Jurassic World producers Pat Crowley and Frank Marshall appear as unlockable characters, as well as the film's director, Colin Trevorrow. Steven Spielberg, who has acted as director and executive producer for films in the series, is also an unlockable character.  The player can also create new human characters by travelling to either the Jurassic Park Visitor Center or the Jurassic World Innovation Center. Hybrid dinosaurs can also be created from various parts of dinosaurs that can be unlocked during the game's progression. Enemies include Compsognathus, Dilophosaurus and Velociraptor.  The 3DS version excludes the free-roaming mode for a central hub instead, but is otherwise nearly identical to the home console versions of the game. The Android and iOS versions also use a main hub section to access levels; because of limitations on digital storage space, these versions feature fewer levels and fewer cutscenes than the home console versions, and the levels are also reduced in size. The iOS version supports use of iCloud and Game Center.   The game follows the storylines from the Jurassic Park films: Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, Jurassic Park III and Jurassic World. However, the developers modified the storylines to fit the events into five levels per film. Notable scenes from each film have been recreated in the game. Serious scenes from the films, including characters' deaths, were replaced with humor for the video game as it was aimed at children (for example, after most scenes depicting a character being eaten by a dinosaur occur, the dinosaur will later on regurgitate the character unharmed).

Interactive Entertainment,"February 1, 2018","November 14, 2017","December 1, 2017"," Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2 is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective. The game features a similar gameplay to its predecessors and other Lego video games, alternating between various action-adventure sequences and puzzle-solving scenarios. The game also introduces a new four-player competitive Super Hero battle mode, allowing players to fight each other cooperatively in battle arenas.   The Guardians of the Galaxy help defend Xandar from an attack by Kang the Conqueror, who wields a time crystal. Kang's ship, the Damocles, launches devices which cause a section of Xandar to disappear. Meanwhile, at Avengers Mansion, Nick Fury presents the Avengers with several missions: Captain America, She-Hulk, and Thor fight the Presence in Siberia; Iron Man and Captain Marvel defeat Attuma at his underwater base; and Spider-Man, Ms. Marvel, and White Tiger battle several escaped supervillains on the Brooklyn Bridge. The Guardians arrive just before Kang, who uses his devices to steal Manhattan with the heroes inside it and makes it part of his battle arena called Chronopolis, consisting of various locales that he has stolen from across time and space with his citadel at its center.  Captain America leads a team through a portal to Medieval England, where they help Sir Percy reclaim his castle from the Enchantress and Nathan Garrett. A team led by She-Hulk follows Klaw through a portal to Wakanda, where Black Panther joins them to fight Man-Ape in the vibranium mines. The heroes converge in a version of Manhattan ruled by Hydra, where they battle Klaw and vibranium soldiers created by Arnim Zola, and defeat Baron Zemo in a dogfight. Thor, Captain Marvel, and She-Hulk travel to a swamp where they vanquish Man-Thing. Kang reveals that Man-Thing was guarding the Nexus of All Realities, which kept the various realms of Chronopolis separated. Kang destroys the Nexus and challenges the heroes to rise up and face him.  Regrouping at Avengers Mansion, the heroes detect a faint signal from outside Chronopolis. Searching for a device to boost its strength, the Guardians travel to the Old West where they battle MODOK and the Circus of Crime. Retrieving the device, they learn that the signal is being sent from Knowhere by Cosmo the Spacedog. The heroes plan to retrieve the fragments of the Nexus in order to bring Knowhere into Chronopolis and use its energies to bring down the barrier surrounding Kang's citadel. In preparation, Doctor Strange leads a team to the Sanctum Sanctorum where they fight Baron Mordo and retrieve the Book of the Vishanti, while Thor leads a party to apocalyptic Asgard to enlist the aid of Heimdall, facing Surtur in the process.  The search for the five Nexus fragments again splits the heroes into teams. Captain America's group travels to the underwater city of Lemuria, but falls into a trap and must battle the Red King and several versions of the Hulk in Sakaar. Joined by the Hulk and Stingray, they return to Lemuria and defeat Attuma, retrieving a fragment. Moving on to Ancient Egypt, they enter a Sphinx and join Horus of the Heliopolitans in facing Loki and N'Kantu, the Living Mummy to obtain another. Spider-Man's group visits the Marvel Noir version of Manhattan, where they help Iron Fist, Daredevil, Luke Cage, and Spider-Man Noir defeat the Kingpin. Iron Fist accompanies them to K'un-L'un, where they fight Steel Serpent to free Shou-Lao and retrieve a Nexus fragment. Proceeding to the Alchemax building in Marvel 2099's Nueva York, Spider-Gwen and Spider-Man 2099 help them defeat the 2099 version of Green Goblin and a fusion of Venom and Carnage to obtain another fragment. In the Kree home world of Hala, the Guardians battle Ronan the Accuser. Meanwhile, in Attilan, the Inhumans defeat Maximus. Black Bolt and Medusa then head to Hala, where they free the Guardians from the control of the Supreme Intelligence and help them retrieve another fragment. As Kang observes the heroes' exploits and plots to destroy them, his assistant Ravonna becomes increasingly disturbed by his actions.  With the fragments gathered, the heroes assemble a device to bring Knowhere through a portal opened by Doctor Strange. Their first attempt nearly brings Ego the Living Planet through instead. Once Knowhere is in Chronopolis, they use an electromagnetic pulse to knock out the energy shield protecting Kang's citadel. As they begin their assault, Kang summons the Damocles. Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Star-Lord disable the ship, battling Korvac and escaping before it crashes. Captain America, Captain Marvel, Doctor Strange, and Star-Lord enter the citadel and face Kang, who grows to gigantic size, uses the time crystal to reverse the Damocles' destruction, and wields it as a sword. Captain America creates a giant solid hologram of himself and uses it to defeat Kang. Ravonna betrays Kang and uses the time crystal to turn him into a baby. The heroes celebrate their victory, and Ravonna promises to return the components of Chronopolis to their original places in time and space once the remaining villains are dealt with.  In a post-credits scene, with everything restored to normal, Iron Man, Captain America, and Captain Marvel are visited by Ravonna in her new alias as Terminatrix. She is accompanied by an elderly Kang, the Supreme Intelligence, Cosmo, and Man-Thing, who inform the Avengers of a ""chronal fracture incident"".  "

The player is a wolflike monster who can freely shapeshift into a princess under most circumstances and must do so to properly escort the prince through the levels. In princess form, the player can hold hands with the prince in order to bring him alongside her and give him simple instructions to perform, such as jumping or telling him to walk left or right for a way. In wolflike form, the player is able to protect the prince from the forest creatures and human enemies in combat, either by directly attacking the creatures or by utilizing the environment in order to do so. There are also environmental puzzles in the forest, such as platforms that react to weight, or heavy objects that block the road and can only be broken by the strength of the wolflike monster. The prince can also hold and place certain objects for the princess while the player guides him to the right position. There are several objects that only the prince can hold, such as fire lanterns.   Every night, on a tall cliff deep within a monster-filled forest, a large wolf monster would sing to the night sky. Her beautiful voice soon attracted the attention of a young prince from the kingdom surrounded by the forest, who began to journey to the forest every night to listen to her. Initially wary of the human, the wolf began to enjoy the prince's admiration for her music, but feared letting the prince discover what she truly was and would run off before he could see her. One night, the Prince climbed up the cliff to see the owner of the lovely voice and the Wolf, caught off guard by the prince's actions, accidentally blinded him when she impulsively tried to cover his eyes. In fear, the prince stumbled backwards and fell off the cliff despite the wolf's attempts to rescue him. After being saved by a guard, drawn over by the commotion, the Prince is imprisoned by his parents as his wound shamed their family. A few days later, the wolf sneaked into the castle upon learning of this and feeling guilty over the prince's misfortune. Telling the prince that she is a princess from a neighboring kingdom, the Wolf decides to take the prince to visit the Witch of the Forest; a mystical being who can grant wishes for a price. But realizing she cannot take him as she is, the Wolf seeks out the Witch and offers her singing voice for human form.   The Witch accepts, giving the Wolf the ability to freely transform yet warned her that the spell would be negated under moonlight. Returning to the castle and freeing the Prince, the Wolf begins her long quest to guide him to the Witch in order to wish for his eyes to be healed. Over the course of the journey, the two begin to bond, though the ""princess's"" unusual mannerisms arouse confusion and eventually suspicion from the Prince. One night, while the Princess was handing the Prince a flower, a moonbeam cast over her hand and returned it to its original form. The Prince, remembering the feel of the arm that blinded him, immediately recognized it and the resulting falling out caused a massive forest fire. The flames eventually reach and consume most of the Witch's collection; the payments of all the wishes she had granted. Infuriated, the Witch transforms into a massive monster and begins to rampage through the forest. After saving the Prince from the fire, the Wolf and prince decide to work together to calm the Witch down in order to apologize. They succeed and though she's still furious with them, the Witch accepts the Wolf's request for the Prince's eyesight restored, though both her ability to transform and her memories of the Prince would be required as payment. The Witch admits that such a price wouldn't normally be required to heal the Prince's eyes alone, but to atone for their sins and to acquire the power needed to heal the forest, she would need the additional magic. Despite Prince's attempting to stop the Wolf from accepting the terms, he is powerless to prevent it.   Sometime after, though now a horrible singer, the Wolf continued singing on a cliff to the night sky until the Prince appeared one night. Having forgotten who he is, the wolf initially attempts to eat him. Before she can do so, the prince gives her a bouquet of flowers, causing the wolf to be overwhelmed by emotions of nostalgia and sorrow. No longer feeling alone, the two sit down next to each other. Despite her lost memories and voice, the Wolf enjoys the Prince's company and continues singing for him from that point on.   "
607,Limbo,/wiki/Limbo_(video_game),Platformer,Playdead,Playdead,"June 28, 2018","June 28, 2018","June 28, 2018"," The player controls the boy throughout the game. As is typical of most two-dimensional platform games, the boy can run left or right, jump, climb onto short ledges or up and down ladders and ropes, and push or pull objects. Limbo is presented through dark, greyscale graphics and with minimalist ambient sounds, creating an eerie, haunting environment. The dark visuals also serve to conceal numerous lethal surprises, including such environmental and physical hazards as deadly bear traps on the forest floor, or lethal monsters hiding in the shadows. Among the hazards are glowing worms, which attach themselves to the boy's head and force him to travel in only one direction until they are killed.  The game's second half features mechanical puzzles and traps using machinery, electromagnets, and gravity. Many of these traps are not apparent until triggered, often killing the boy. The player is able to restart at the last encountered checkpoint, with no limits placed on how many times this can occur. Some traps can be avoided and used later in the game; one bear trap is used to clamp onto an animal's carcass, hung from the end of a rope, tearing the carcass off the rope and allowing the branch and rope to retract upwards and allow the boy to climb onto a ledge otherwise out of reach. As the player will likely encounter numerous deaths before they solve each puzzle and complete the game, the developers call Limbo a ""trial and death"" game. Some deaths are animated with images of the boy's dismemberment or beheading, although an optional gore filter blacks out the screen instead of showing these deaths. Game achievements (optional in-game goals) include finding hidden insect eggs and completing the game with five or fewer deaths.   The primary character in Limbo is a nameless boy, who awakens in the middle of a forest on the ""edge of hell"" (the game's title is taken from the Latin limbus, meaning ""edge""),  where he encounters a giant spider who tries to kill him. After using a trap to cut off the sharp points on half of the spider's legs, it retreats further into the forest, and the boy is allowed to pass. However, he is later caught in webs and spun into a cocoon. After breaking free from the threads that attached him to the roof, he is forced to hop, and eventually gets them off. After a while seeking his missing sister, he encounters only a few human characters who either attack him, run away, or are dead/dying. At one point during his journey, he encounters a female character, who he thinks might be his sister, but is prevented from reaching her. The forest eventually gives way to a crumbling city environment. On completion of the final puzzle, the boy is thrown through a pane of glass and back into the forest. After he wakes up and recovers from the pain and shock, he walks a short distance until he again encounters a girl, who, upon his approach, stands up, startled. At this point, the screen cuts to black, abruptly ending the game.  "
608,Little Busters!,/wiki/Little_Busters!,Visual novel,Key,Prototype,"April 23, 2020","April 23, 2020","April 23, 2020"," Little Busters! is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Riki Naoe. Much of its gameplay is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. The text in the game is accompanied by character sprites, which represent who Riki is talking to, over background art. Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character sprites. When the game is completed at least once, a gallery of the viewed CGs and played background music becomes available on the game's title screen. Little Busters! follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.   There are seven main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and make different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. When first playing the game, the scenarios for all six heroines are available. Once a scenario for any one heroine is completed, that scenario will be unavailable in the next play through because the last choice that will ultimately lead to that heroine's scenario becomes unavailable for players to choose. After the completion of these six routes, the final scenario called Refrain is made available, which serves to bring everything to a definite conclusion and answers questions brought up throughout the normal gameplay. Completing Refrain makes available all the heroine's scenarios that were previously made inaccessible during gameplay so that the player can revisit the scenarios again, along with some extra decision points that were previously unavailable. Throughout gameplay, the player encounters various minigames, which range from simple to more complex. The first type of minigame encountered is a battle sequence that resembles a fighting game, but no interaction from the player is required to fight. These recurring battle sequences represent when the members of the Little Busters get into physical fights with either each other or with others. Each member of the fight has a set of statistics attributed to them (which includes strength, stamina, agility, reflex, concentration, judgment, and luck) along with a life bar to keep track of how many hit points a fighter has left. The maximum number of hit points is determined by the given fighter's stamina rating. Weapons may be used along with any accessories the fighter has in their possession, and these items may be exchanged with other characters. Another recurring minigame involves the player being able to play baseball batting practice with members of the Little Busters. The player, as Riki, controls his position and when to swing the bat.  The Little Busters will also participate in missions to accomplish some goal, and a mission will either be completed or failed depending on the choices of the player. These missions are connected with the battle sequences and batting practice in that they serve to give the characters experience, obtain accessories to use during fights, and improve their statistics. However, these missions do not affect the main plot in any way—the player even has the choice to turn off most of the minigames so that the player may focus on the main plot, including the battle sequences and batting practice. The first time that the game is played, Rin's statistics are weak compared to other characters. However, when the player completes several heroine's routes, Rin's and Riki's statistics will start out higher than before when the player starts a new game, allowing Rin and Riki to stand a better chance against opponents with higher statistics. The statistics of the Little Busters members are shown in a ranking system from highest to lowest in overall statistics.  Despite Little Busters! having a rating for all ages, there is an ample amount of CG artwork featuring the female characters in risqué situations, though never to the point to be considered sexual in nature. This is in stark contrast to Key's previous titles Clannad and Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet that also have ratings for all ages, but those titles contain no such risqué situations or even any fan service.  In Little Busters! Ecstasy, adult elements were added to the gameplay in the form of sexual CGs depicting Riki and a given heroine having sex. Ecstasy extends the story for the scenarios of the heroines in Little Busters!, as well as increasing the number of heroine routes from six to nine. These three heroine routes include scenarios for Kanata Futaki and Sasami Sasasegawa—two supporting characters from Little Busters!—and a new heroine named Saya Tokido who is only featured in Ecstasy. The first time the game is played, these three heroine routes are unavailable to the player until after the Refrain scenario is completed, though the player is given the option to make them immediately available. Ecstasy has several minor additions and changes to the minigames as well, including the addition of weapons available for use in the battle sequences. Also, Ecstasy features the addition of two recurring minigames related to Saya: a shooting game with pistols and navigating a labyrinth.   "
610,Little Inferno,/wiki/Little_Inferno,Puzzle,Tomorrow Corporation,Tomorrow Corporation,"June 1, 2017","March 16, 2017","March 23, 2017"," Little Inferno is a sandbox-oriented puzzle video game primarily viewed from a first-person perspective. The player assumes the role of a small, largely unseen character who possesses the fictional ""Little Inferno Entertainment Fireplace,"" which he uses to incinerate various objects, such as toys and appliances, to keep warm (necessary due to a seemingly unending drop in the game world's temperature). The objects release money when they are burned, which is used to purchase more burnable objects from mail order catalogs. In order to progress the narrative, the player must burn the newest objects available to them, unlocking new catalogs and expanding the selection of (more expensive) objects. There is no scoring system, nor are there any penalties or time limits imposed on the player, allowing him or her to freely experiment with burning any combination of objects. The game uses a drag and drop interface to position and ignite the objects. The PC versions are controlled using a mouse, while the Wii U version can be controlled with the Wii Remote pointer or with the Wii U GamePad's touchscreen, which also allows for Off-TV Play.  Many of the game's available objects possess special properties that may influence the other objects in the fireplace. For example, frozen objects such as dry ice cause others to freeze and easily shatter, and objects with strong gravitational pull move or attract all other objects. When set on fire, many objects react by activating, exploding, or changing the properties of the flames. All objects automatically vanish from the fireplace upon being reduced to ash.  Little Inferno offers the player several goals to achieve. The player can trigger ""Combos"" when two or three specific objects are burned simultaneously. The player is presented with a list of the game's 99 possible Combos; the names of the Combos hint the relationship of the required objects, and it is up to the player to determine the correct objects to burn. By burning new Combos, the player can earn stamps which speed up shipping new objects, along with a small amount of bonus money.  "

Armed with only a lighter, she sneaks through the bowels of the Maw, a massive iron vessel designed for much larger inhabitants. Throughout the Maw, she encounters several Nomes, small, skittish creatures that either flee her or passively observe her efforts. Through the Prison, where captured children are held, she evades carnivorous leeches that infest its depths and a pair of artificial eyes that will turn her to stone should she be caught in their lights.   Six regularly experiences crippling bouts of hunger. On the first of these instances, another child gives her a piece of bread to eat. She is then captured by the blind, long-armed Janitor when he lures her into a cage with a piece of meat. She escapes but makes no effort to help the other children. She then falls into a room filled with piles of shoes and evades the unseen monster burrowing underneath. The Janitor eventually pursues Six into an elevator, where she severs his arms with the collapsing door.   Caught by another bout of hunger, Six is forced to eat a live rat which has been caught in a mousetrap. Via a conveyor belt, she travels to the Kitchen, where children wrapped up in paper are being sent. Here, the grotesque Twin Chefs are preparing a large feast and attempt to add Six to their recipe whenever she enters their line of sight. She escapes and makes her way outside, to the hull of the Maw, above the ocean waves.  Scaling the hull, Six witnesses a procession of obese, suited Guests from their vessel into the mouth of the Maw. They lumber into the Japanese-style dining hall, where they gorge themselves on red meat and wine. This feast is overseen by the mysterious Lady—the masked, Geisha-like woman from Six’s dream. Noticing Six, several guests scramble after her, but she escapes. When she has another hunger attack, a friendly Nome offers her a sausage. However, having seen where the meat comes from, Six eats the Nome instead. As she does so, a shadowy, flickering vision of herself looks on.   Via an elevator, Six follows the Lady up into her Quarters, which are strewn with broken mirrors. The Lady takes notice of Six and pursues her through a dark corridor. Six finds an unbroken mirror, which she uses to repel the Lady when she tries to ambush her from the shadows. The sight of her own reflection causes the Lady pain and finally subdues her and knocks off her mask. As the Lady lies defenseless, Six approaches her and experiences a final hunger attack. She bites into the Lady’s neck, killing her and absorbing her magical powers.   Six walks back through the dining area, surrounded by a shadowy aura. The Guests try to eat her, but their lives are instantly drained by her new powers. She passes through a door with an eye encrusted in it and proceeds up a staircase and out into the sunlight, while some Nomes wait behind at the open doorway.   In the post-credits scene, Six is seen sitting by the entrance of the Maw waiting to be rescued while a foghorn is heard in the distance, implying that a ship is coming her way.  "
614,Long Live the Queen,/wiki/Long_Live_the_Queen_(video_game),Visual novel,Hanako Games,Ratalaika Games,Unreleased,2020,2020," The queen of Nova has recently died, and her daughter, the 14-year-old princess Elodie, must leave her schooling to ready herself to become the next queen. Her coronation is set for 40 weeks from the present—her 15th birthday. Many people in the kingdom are trying to take advantage of the recent monarch's death and attempt to kill Elodie.   The player reads through the story and schedules the protagonist's weekly lessons, in topics such as economy, foreign affairs, logistics, expression, military matters, self-defense, intrigues, doublespeak and magic.  Based on those activities, Elodie increases her proficiency in various statistics.  Additionally, during the weekend Elodie has free run of the castle and can choose an activity that alters her mood.  She has four emotional axes, and her position on each determines her proficiency at learning certain topics: for instance, being ""Willful"" will help her master military and intrigue skills easier, but it will also hamper learning civil skills like royal demeanor. Once all three sub skills of a particular skill are raised to a certain point (around 30 each), Elodie gains an outfit that boosts that specific skill. Learning some skills unlocks additional weekend actions: for example, learning ""Dance"" allows her to attend balls, while ""Reflexes"" gives her the ability to play tennis.  As the weeks progress, Elodie is presented with various social and political opportunities.  When they occur, the game performs checks against Elodie's current skills and chooses an outcome, sometimes without giving the player the option of interceding. For instance, one of the first skill checks (a snake attack) requires 10 points in the ""Composure"" skill. Should Elodie be successful, she keeps her cool, allowing a guard to kill the snake; should she fail, her cousin gets bitten, an event whose consequences can be felt in one specific route the game can take. Most of the checks can be failed without serious consequence, but some can close off entire branches of the story. Very often however, passing or failing a skill check is a matter of life or death for Elodie: if her skills aren't up to par, she dies (in one of various possible ways).  Because of the branching decision trees, the game features multiple endings, varying according to whom Elodie marries, how she dealt with neighboring nations, her ability with magic, the fate of her father Joslyn, and—of course—whether she survived to her coronation at all.

Each player controls only a single avatar (as well as commanding the AI pet in single-player mode), and thus must constantly move from station to station in order to balance flying the ship, protecting it from damage, and attacking enemies. During the course of gameplay, gift boxes can be discovered which may contain gems. These gems can be attached to the stations, giving them new, enhanced powers.  The game consists of four campaigns; each contains four levels and a boss fight. The goal of the regular levels is to find and rescue an assortment of captured creatures including bunnies, frogs, foxes, and ducks. After capturing five such creatures in a level, a heart-shaped portal to the next level is unlocked and the players may enter it to complete the level. A few levels feature an alternative gameplay mode in which a special engine is attached to the ship which the players must protect as it warps the ship to a new area. Up to ten creatures may be rescued per level. Creatures saved count towards improving the effectiveness of the ship by allowing two gems per station or unlocking new ship layouts.  "
619,Luigi's Mansion 3,/wiki/Luigi%27s_Mansion_3,Action-adventure,Next Level Games,Nintendo,"October 31, 2019","October 31, 2019","October 31, 2019"," Luigi's Mansion 3 is an action-adventure game, in which players control the character of Luigi from a fixed third-person perspective, as they capture ghosts across a large hotel setting. The game features two modes of gameplay – a single-player story mode, and a set of multiplayer game modes – in which ghost catching functions in the same manner as previous installments: players stun ghosts with Luigi's flashlight, snag them with his Poltergust, and weaken their health down to 0 in order to capture them.   Luigi, his pet ghost dog Polterpup, his brother Mario, Princess Peach and a group of Toads receive an invitation to the luxurious high-rise hotel of the Last Resort, and decide to visit it for a vacation. The princess and Mario are talking, the Toads are playing catch, and Luigi is sleeping with Polterpup. After arriving and settling in, Luigi awakens during the night to find the hotel deserted, transformed into a haunted building, and the others missing. He discovers that the hotel's ghostly owner, Hellen Gravely, had lured the group to the hotel as part of a trap by King Boo, whom she had freed from his imprisonment after Luigi's last ghost-catching adventure in Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon. King Boo reveals he is enraged with Luigi and wants to end things with him once and for all. Learning that the others have been imprisoned in portraits, Luigi is forced to flee to avoid the same fate, and narrowly escapes to the basement by using a laundry chute. With the help of his flashlight and Polterpup, who also avoided capture, Luigi explores the basement and comes across a car in the underground garage carrying a new Poltergust model G-00. Using it, Luigi makes his way to the lobby, following his ghost dog, and finds that Professor E. Gadd was also captured.  Searching the lobby floor, Luigi comes across his Dark Light bulb in a safe and uses it to free E. Gadd, who asks him to take him into the basement. Setting up a portable lab in the garage, E. Gadd explains how he had been tricked into visiting the hotel and was captured by Hellen, who stole his ghost collection from him to staff the building. Believing that Luigi's friends are likely trapped on the upper floors, E. Gadd recommends that Luigi finds the elevator buttons for the upper floor that had been taken from the main elevator, after he secures two from a ghost he had defeated earlier. While exploring the floors, each featuring a different theme to them, Luigi is aided further by the professor with two new gadgets: the Virtual Boo, a device that allows E. Gadd to communicate with Luigi; and Gooigi, a doppelgänger of Luigi made of lime-green goo. Left with no choice, Luigi begins his search for the missing elevator buttons in order to visit each of the hotel's fifteen floors.  As Luigi makes his search, he comes across and defeats a variety of different ghosts, including Hellen, while reclaiming the elevator buttons and rescuing the Toads and Mario from their portraits. After rescuing his brother, Luigi finds himself following Mario to the roof and finds Peach's portrait through his help. Upon freeing Peach, the group find King Boo (who had long lost faith in Hellen and the ghosts' capabilities) waiting to deal with them. King Boo recaptures E. Gadd and the Toads in front of their faces, throwing them into a painting. King Boo swiftly imprisons everyone except for Luigi, who is saved at the last second by Polterpup. Luigi finds himself forced to defeat King Boo once again, aided by Gooigi. During the battle, an increasingly livid King Boo enlarges the portrait frame in an attempt to pull in the whole hotel with Luigi still on the roof. Luigi defeats King Boo and manages to recover the portrait moments before the hotel collapses into a ruined mess due to the battle. After freeing his friends from the portrait, the ghosts Luigi captured are released and slowly return to being friendly after King Boo's control over them fades away after the large gem from his crown vanishes. E. Gadd, seeing them upset that the hotel was destroyed, elects for the group to build a new hotel, whereupon Luigi and his friends depart after its grand reopening. Depending on how many coins Luigi collected, the hotel will be a different size. Luigi then returns to sleeping on the bus.  "
620,Lumines Remastered,/wiki/Lumines_Remastered,Puzzle,Resonair,Enhance Games,"June 26, 2018","June 26, 2018","June 26, 2018"," Lumines: Puzzle Fusion is a tile-matching video game similar to Columns and Tetris. The playing field consists of a 16×10 grid. A sequence of 2×2 blocks varying between two colors fall from the top of the playing field. When part of a falling block hits an obstruction, the remaining portion divides and continues to fall. A square is created when a group of 2×2 blocks of the same color is created on the playing field. A vertical time line that sweeps through the playing field from left to right clears any completed squares it touches. Points are awarded to the player for any squares erased. If the square is created in the middle of the time line, only take half of the square is taken and no points are awarded.  The objective is to rotate and align the blocks to create squares of the same color. The player earns increasing score multipliers by repeatedly clearing squares on consecutive time line sweeps. Bonuses are earned by reducing remaining tiles to a single color or for removing inactive tiles from the screen. Blocks with gems are known as ""special blocks""; if these are used to create squares, they allow adjacent blocks of the same color to be eliminated by the time line. Squares of the same color can be grouped to create overlapping squares. The player loses the game when the blocks pile up to the top of the grid. The game ends when the blocks reach the top of the screen.  Each stage has a skin that affects the background's appearance, the blocks' color scheme, music track and sound effects. Each skin also changes the rate at which the time line crosses the screen because it moves in time with the music. Progressing through the game modes unlocks skins, which can affect the gameplay; fast tempos make create large combos more difficult and slow tempos may cause the playing field to fill faster while the player waits for the time line to sweep across the screen.  There are four modes in the game: Challenge, Time Attack, Puzzle, and Vs mode. Challenge Mode cycles through skins in a fixed order of increasing difficulty. The maximum score in Challenge Mode is 999,999 points. Time Attack games give the player a limited time to clear as many blocks as possible. Puzzle mode challenges the player to create pictures using blocks In Vs mode, players battle against A.I. opponents or other players using their wireless connections. Vs mode begins with the playing field divided in half; the goal is to clear successive squares to reduce the space from the opposing player.  "

622,Machinarium,/wiki/Machinarium,Adventure,Amanita Design,Amanita Design,Unreleased,"November 1, 2018","November 1, 2018"," The goal of Machinarium is to solve a series of puzzles and brain teasers. The puzzles are linked together by an overworld consisting of a traditional ""point and click"" adventure story. The overworld's most radical departure is that only objects within the player character's reach can be clicked on.  Machinarium is notable in that it contains no dialogue, spoken or written, and apart from a few tutorial prompts on the first screen, is devoid of understandable language entirely. The game instead uses a system of animated thought bubbles. Easter egg backstory scenes in the same format can only be revealed by idling in certain areas.  The game employs a two-tier hint system. Once per level, the player can receive a hint, which becomes increasingly vague as the game progresses. Machinarium also comes with a walkthrough, that can be accessed at any time by playing a minigame. As with dialogue, the walkthrough is not in written or spoken form, but instead a series of sketches describing the puzzle at hand and its solution. However, the walkthrough only reveals what must be done in that area, and not how that puzzle relates to the game chronology.  summary  Machinarium opens with an overview of the eponymous city as a disposal flier launches from the pinnacle of its highest tower.  The player character, a robot called Josef (named after Josef Čapek, the creator of the word ""robot"" and brother to Karel Čapek) is dumped on a scrapheap, where he re-assembles himself and sets off for the city. Entering the city, he discovers a plot by the Black Cap Brotherhood, his three criminal antagonists, to blow up the city's tower. He is himself then discovered and locked up.  After breaking out of prison, Josef aids the citizens of the city, as he discovers the mischief which the Brotherhood has been working.  Shortly after flooding the Brotherhood's room (leaving them helpless), Josef locates his girlfriend Berta, who has been locked up and forced to cook. Unable to free her, he works his way to the top of the tower. After he foils the Black Cap Brotherhood's plot by disarming the bomb taped to the tower, Josef reaches the highest room, in which the story began.  A huge-headed robot, the ""head"" of the city, sits in the middle of the room, incapacitated and gibbering. Josef recalls how the three of them lived happily until the Black Cap Brotherhood zapped this friend, leaving him disabled, and kidnapped Berta. When a garbage sucker arrived to dispose of the Black Cap thug, it apprehended Josef instead.  After this revelation, Josef restores his friend to sanity, dumps the Brotherhood down a drain, and frees Berta. The two of them climb back to the tower, wave goodbye to their friend, and fly off into the sunset.  In the final closing scene, their vehicle suffers a collision and falls, and they are seen being carried away separately by two fliers.  "

624,Maneater,/wiki/Maneater_(video_game),Simulation,Blindside,Tripwire Interactive,Unreleased,2020,2020," The game is an action role-playing game played from a third-person perspective. In the game, the player assumes control of a baby bull shark who must take revenge on shark hunter named Scaly Pete, who killed its mother and disfigured it. The shark has several basic attacks, including charging into enemies, siloing out of the water, and whipping enemies with its tail to stun them. It can also use its surroundings for combat advantages, such as using a swordfish as a spear.  The shark needs to hunt and consume other aquatic wildlife such as fish and turtles in order to obtain nutrients, namely proteins, fats, minerals, and rare mutagenics. Players can also attack humans by wreaking havoc along the coast, destroying yachts and ships, and knocking people off jet skis. As the player gains enough nutrients, the shark must enter underwater grottos to unlock new abilities and increase in size, which allows the shark to take on larger and deadlier creatures. The shark will slowly evolve into an adult megalodon, and players can acquire advanced upgrades and customization options such as external bone plates and electromagnetic spikes to further enhance the shark's combat abilities.  Playing as the shark, players can freely explore the open world of Port Clovis, which consists of seven regions. Players can discover hidden landmarks and complete side objectives. Each region will also have its own apex predator, such as alligators, sperm whales, orcas, and even other sharks, which may kill the shark. Defeating these predators will earn the player special skills. The world is reactive. As the shark creates more havoc, human Bounty Hunters will be dispatched to hunt it down. If the shark manages to kill the ten lead hunters, which are named characters, it will receive additional rewards. The game is narrated by the host of an in-game reality TV show titled Maneaters vs. Sharkhunters (voiced by Chris Parnell), who guides the player throughout the game.   A film crew for a reality television show follows experienced Cajun shark hunter Pierre ""Scaly Pete"" LeBlanc and his son Kyle as they hunt for an adult bull shark with a harpoon in its side owned by Scaly Pete's father. They manage to capture the shark after it goes on a killing spree at a beach. After discovering that the bull shark is pregnant, the film crew are shocked when Scaly Pete cuts out the infant shark and uses his knife to identify with it later as it grows, though he loses his right hand in the process.  The infant shark grows larger over time by eating fish, sea mammals, humans and apex predators. Other shark hunters eventually go after the shark, but are killed and eaten. Back on Scaly Pete's boat the Cajun Queen, tensions grow between him and his son over the claims that Scaly Pete’s father was killed by a megalodon, even though that is believed to be extinct for over two million years. They eventually relocate the shark and attempt to kill it. They try burning the shark alive after it eats Scaly Pete's left leg, but the shark escapes and Kyle is killed in an explosion that causes the Cajun Queen to sink and leaves Scaly Pete disfigured.  As the shark continues to grow, the film crew grow concerned for Scaly Pete’s sanity after losing Kyle as he prepares to use extreme methods to kill the shark. He eventually repairs and arms his father's old PT 522 navy patrol boat with military grade firepower. He attacks the film crew after they attempt to talk him out of it and sets out to kill the shark, which has by now evolved into a megashark. The shark ultimately gets the upper hand on Scaly Pete, who in a last ditch effort, uses explosives to kill himself and the shark.  "

The main single-player campaign has players control a robot named Beep-0 and lead a team of three heroes, including Mario, through four worlds split into multiple chapters, each composed of one or more battles. Along the way, the player can find alternate paths and solve puzzles on the game's overworld to locate hidden chests containing new weapons or bonus material such as 3D models and concept art. As the player progresses through the game, Beep-0 can learn new abilities, such as pushing blocks and carrying statues to access previously inaccessible areas.  Battles take place when the player reaches an enemy-inhabited territory. While most battles typically require the player to eliminate all or a certain number of enemies, some missions feature other objectives such as reaching a specific area or escorting another character. In these turn-based battles, control alternates between the player's team of three heroes and the enemy team. During each turn, players can perform up to three actions with each of their available heroes; Movement, Attack, and Ability. In the movement phase, players move a cursor to direct a character to a place on the field within their movement range. Characters can dash into enemies to deal extra damage, enter white pipes to reach other parts of the map, and leap off of each other to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Each hero can attack with their main weapon, which range from simple blasters to wide-spreading shotguns, or secondary weapons such as melee weapons or grenades. Certain weapons may trigger status effects, such as dealing extra damage with Bounce or Fire damage or inhibiting certain actions with Freeze or Honey attacks. The effectiveness of an attack varies depending on whether the target is shielded by the environment (for example, characters hiding behind a half-sized wall have a 50% chance of getting hit). Finally, Abilities are unique support effects, ranging from barriers that can lessen damage to overwatch attacks that can be triggered outside of an Attack command. Certain weapons and abilities have cooldowns, requiring players to wait a certain number of turns before they can be used again. Additionally, certain characters possess passive abilities that are unique to them. For example, Peach can recover health upon landing from a team jump while Rabbid Luigi can absorb health from dashing into opponents.  Players lose a battle when all of their heroes run out of health and are knocked out, or fail a level-specific objective. When the player clears a chapter, they receive coins and Skill Orbs, which can also be found by exploring the overworld, with greater rewards earned clearing battles within a certain number of turns with all characters intact. Coins can be spent on new weapons for each character, with more options becoming available as the player finds Weapon Chests. Skill Orbs can be used on each character's Skill Tree, granting them new unique abilities or increases to stats such as health and movement range. After clearing a world, players can revisit them to take on additional challenge-based missions. Players can also unlock co-operative challenges, in which two players, each with a team of two heroes, must work together to clear objectives. Additional weapons can be unlocked by scanning compatible Amiibo figures.   In a certain world, a young inventor and avid Super Mario fan, with the help of her robot assistant Beep-0, has invented a device known as the SupaMerge helmet, which can merge any two objects into a single entity. She invented it with the intention to solve an energy crisis, but the device has a problem with overheating.  While the inventor is out of the room, a group of Rabbids arrive in their Time Washing Machine and begin playing with her things, annoying Beep-0. One of them puts on the SupaMerge helmet and starts causing chaos, merging some of the Rabbids with several items in the room: one with a cell phone and a Princess Peach wig into Rabbid Peach, a second with a balloon into a Rabbid balloon, a third with a Mario hat into Rabbid Mario, and a fourth with some sunglasses and a toy sunflower into a living sunflower. While having fun with the helmet, it accidentally hits the Time Washing Machine and causes a malfunction, sucking the Rabbids and Beep-0 into an interdimensional vortex. At that time, another vortex appears above the Mushroom Kingdom during the unveiling of a large statue of Princess Peach and sucks up everyone, including Mario and his friends. As both Mario's friends and the Rabbids are thrown across the Mushroom Kingdom, Beep-0 discovers that the SupaMerge helmet has merged itself with the Rabbid wearing it, who starts causing more chaos by merging more things. While most of the merged Rabbids become hostile, Mario and Beep-0 encounter two good Rabbids: Rabbid Luigi and Rabbid Peach. Aided by a mysterious e-mail contact known only as F.B. (who also provides them with weapons to help them), the four decide to team up to put a stop to the chaos.  As Mario's team travels across the Mushroom Kingdom, defeating the corrupted Rabbids while also encountering allies both old and Rabbid (consisting of Princess Peach, Luigi, Rabbid Mario, Yoshi, and Rabbid Yoshi), Bowser Jr. comes across the SupaMerged Rabbid, which he nicknames Spawny, and takes him under his wing to cause more chaos. Resolving to recover Spawny so they can undo the damage he has caused, the team eventually learn that an entity known as the Megabug is behind the mysterious vortex, which grows more powerful as they defeat more corrupted Rabbids. The gang recover Spawny from Bowser Jr., only for him to get kidnapped by the Megabug, who then merges itself with Bowser to become MegaDragonBowser. Mario's team defeats the Megabug, saving both Bowser and Spawny. As peace returns to the Mushroom Kingdom and all the Rabbids are restored to normal, Beep-0 comes to the realization that F.B. is actually his future self (F.B. stands for Future Beep-0) and uses the Time Washing Machine to help his comrades in the past by sending the same emails and weapons that his future self sent to him to his past self.

In addition, the game includes four different difficulties, which can be selected before beginning the race to challenge players. Returning features from previous installments include motorbikes and 12-player racing from Mario Kart Wii, as well as hang gliders, underwater racing and vehicle customization from Mario Kart 7.  Mario Kart 8's new features include anti-gravity racing, in which certain parts of a track can allow racers to drive on walls and ceilings. During these sections, players can bump into other racers or special bumpers to trigger a Spin Boost, which gives them an extra speed boost. New characters include The Koopalings and Pink Gold Peach. There are four new items: the Boomerang Flower, which can be thrown to attack players, the Piranha Plant, which attacks nearby racers and obstacles, the Crazy Eight, which gives the user eight items, and the Super Horn, which can be used both to attack nearby opponents and defend against items, including the previously nearly unavoidable Spiny Shell. The game features 32 tracks in eight cups (Mushroom, Flower, Star, Special, Shell, Banana, Leaf, and Lightning), with an additional 16 later released as downloadable content (DLC) in four additional cups: Egg, Triforce, Crossing, and Bell.  Along with local multiplayer, Mario Kart 8 supports online multiplayer with up to twelve players and voice chat outside of races, however voice chat is only available with friends online. Prior to the cancellation of Nintendo's Miiverse social network on November 7, 2017, players could set up tournaments with customizable rules and schedules, share races automatically recorded in-game to the online video platform YouTube, and receive in-game stamps for use on Miiverse by beating staff times and completing Grand Prix races. Due to the cancellation of Miiverse, these features have been removed from the game, although downloading ghost data from friends or top players is still possible.   The Wii U version of the game is compatible with the Wii U GamePad, Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Wii U Pro Controller, Wii Classic Controller and Wii Wheel, while the Nintendo Switch version can be played with an individual Joy-Con turned on its side, the Joy-Con Grip controller shell, the console tablet with both Joy-Con attached, or the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. Players can use Amiibo figures to unlock Nintendo-themed costumes that can be worn by Miis. A free software update to the Nintendo Switch version was made in June 2018 that allows players to use the Toy-Con Motorbike from the Nintendo Labo Variety Kit as a compatible motion controller.  "
628,Mario Tennis Aces,/wiki/Mario_Tennis_Aces,Sports,Camelot Software Planning,Nintendo,"June 22, 2018","June 22, 2018","June 22, 2018"," The gameplay of Mario Tennis Aces consists of playing matches of tennis with various characters from the Super Mario series. Players can pick from Mario, Luigi, Wario, Peach, Waluigi, Daisy, Rosalina, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Bowser, Toad, Toadette, Chain Chomp, Bowser Jr., Boo, and Spike. New characters are added by participating in monthly tournaments, or are added to the roster the following month if the player does not participate. Numerous characters have been added in the game such as; Koopa Troopa in July 2018, Blooper in August 2018, Diddy Kong in September 2018, Birdo in October 2018, Koopa Paratroopa in November 2018, Petey Piranha and Shy Guy in December 2018, Luma in January 2019, Boom Boom in February 2019, Pauline in March 2019, Kamek in April 2019, Dry Bones in May 2019, Fire Piranha Plant in June 2019, and Dry Bowser in July 2019. Similar in fashion to previous installments of the series, Aces incorporates many techniques, such as ""topspins"", where the ball travels parallel to the direction hit, ""slices"", where the ball curves to one side when hit, and ""lobs"", where the ball travels upwards.  Aces adds several new mechanics to the Mario Tennis series. Using the motion controls of the Joy-Con, the player is able to initiate a ""zone shot"", where the player can aim directly where the ball will go while the game enters a paused state. If the opponent counters the zone shot, their racket will take damage. When a racket is hit with a zone shot three times, it will break, forcing the player to forfeit the match if it is their last one. Players have multiple rackets to use each match. However, players are able to counter a zone shot without taking damage using a ""block"", which can be performed by hitting the ball with perfect timing. Another new addition in Aces is ""zone speed"". When a player activates zone speed, the match goes into slow-motion, but their character moves at normal speed, making it so faraway shots are easier to reach. The zone shot and zone speed moves use up part of the players' energy gauge, which is filled and depleted throughout the match. To refill the gauge, the player must keep a rally going with the opponent or use the trick shot ability.  The trick shot ability enables the player to quickly travel to where the ball will land. If the trick shot succeeds, then the player's energy gauge will increase dramatically. However, it is easy to misjudge the timing and therefore is a risky move to make. Another ability available to players at the cost of their energy gauge is the special shot. To activate it, the player must have a full energy gauge. The ability unleashes an extremely powerful shot that has the power to break the opponent's racket regardless of its current damage. However, the special shot can be blocked similarly to the zone shot. Aces also has a ""simple rules"" mode, where only simple shots are allowed and zone shots, zone speed, trick shots, special shots and the energy gauge are nonexistent.  The game also features an online multiplayer mode, where tournaments can be set up, as well as singular matches. Players can unlock additional outfits and characters by participating in special online Tournaments held by Nintendo. Another gameplay mode is ""swing mode"", where players are able to swing the Joy-Con controllers to simulate hitting the ball with a tennis racket, similar in fashion to Wii Sports and New Play Control Mario Power Tennis. In addition to regular tennis matches, the game offers a story mode similar in fashion to Mario Tennis: Power Tour.   Wario and Waluigi are mining at the Temple of Bask when they discover a treasure chest containing Lucien, a racket said to be legendary to those who would possess it. The duo perceive themselves as displaying pride at matches using Lucien, and open up the treasure chest to unveil it. Just as they obtain Lucien, the racket unveils its power and shocks the duo.  The duo soon emerge at Marina Stadium, immediately following a championship match in which Mario and Peach won against Bowser and Bowser Jr. The duo attempt to offer Lucien to Mario, but Luigi snatches it up, after which it begins to take possession of him, Wario, and Waluigi, through use of the grip tape. Mario and Toad then embark on a journey to destroy Lucien and save Wario, Luigi and Waluigi, on Daisy's promise that Luigi will be brought back safely.  Mario and Toad soon arrive at the Bask Ruins, where they meet Aster, guardian of King Bask and watcher over Lucien. Aster tells the backstory of Lucien and how many years ago, King Bask stripped Lucien's power and divided it among 5 stones hidden on the island, and years later the room fell to ruin, breaking the seal and allowing the racket to fall into new hands. Aster requests that Mario find the five hidden power stones on the island to end Lucien, once and for all.  Mario obtains the first three power stones by defeating Petey Pirahna in Pirahna Plant Forest, The Mirror Queen in Mirage Mansion, and the Snow Ogre in at the summit of Snowfall Mountain respectively. Mario tries to claim the power stones in the Savage Sea and Inferno Island, but Wario, Waluigi, and Luigi claim the last two Power Stones. Wario and Waluigi decide to settle the score at Marina Stadium; whoever wins receives all five Power Stones.  The Princesses take on Wario and Waluigi while Mario takes on Luigi, with slight power given to them by Aster. The Princesses and Mario win, allowing them to receive the Power Stones, but Bowser gets ahold of Lucien before this can happen, and makes off to the Temple of Bask with it. Mario confronts him inside the Temple and not only defeats him, but breaks Lucien causing the entire Temple to collapse. With the spirit of King Bask now able to rest in peace, Aster thanks Mario for his heroism throughout the quest.  Back outside, everyone celebrates Mario's victory in banishing Lucien and saving Luigi, Wario and Waluigi, although the latter two are shamed by Daisy for attempting to use Lucien to be the best tennis players. The gang agrees that getting stronger is better than trying to control others.  "
629,Mark of the Ninja,/wiki/Mark_of_the_Ninja,Action,Klei Entertainment,Klei Entertainment,Unreleased,"October 9, 2018","October 9, 2018"," Mark of the Ninja consists of stealth-oriented 2D platforming. The character is required to sneak through a series of environments while staying out of sight of guards and performing silent assassinations. Levels are divided into areas of light and darkness; the player character is visible to enemies in the former and invisible in the latter, though passing within a certain immediate distance of an enemy's face results in the player being spotted irrespective of lighting. Sounds such as running may also give away the player character's location and are represented visually by a rapidly expanding circle. Unusual for a platformer, Mark of the Ninja employs a line of sight mechanic, meaning that enemies which would be invisible to the character are also invisible to the player, though their sounds are represented on screen in the same manner as the player character's.  By approaching enemies undetected, the player character is able to execute a ""one-hit"" kill. To facilitate this, the player can extinguish light sources, hide behind objects and pass through narrow grates and shafts inaccessible to enemies. If detected, they must evade their enemies and remain out of sight for a set period of time, after which enemies will return to their original patrol routes and one-hit kills on them will once more be possible. Although fighting hand-to-hand with the goal of quickly disabling an enemy is possible, doing so risks being killed or disabled in turn, as well as alerting nearby enemies with a noisy scuffle. Enemies respond to their environment and one another; they will sound an alarm if they unambiguously spot the player character or find a body, which will alert all enemies in the area and prevent them from returning to their previous patrol routes. If they hear a sound or get a glimpse of the player character they become suspicious, displaying a question mark over their head and actively searching for the player character until they are convinced he is not actually present. They are also subject to terror tactics, and the player can learn to kill and display enemies in a terrifying manner, such as leaving a strangled enemy dangling from a perch or throwing a dead body at an unsuspecting live enemy, causing them to display an exclamation mark over their head, scream, stumble, and fire wildly at anything which scares or startles them.  The player receives points for executing a variety of tactics such as silent kills, passing by enemies without being detected, successfully preventing the discovery of bodies, terrorizing opponents to cause them to fall into disarray, and achieving optional goals such as recovering artifacts and a series of haiku which tell the history of the ninja clan. This score is reduced when an alert is sounded by enemy guards. Depending on the player's performance on the stages, they earn honor and complete seals that are used to buy or upgrade skills and weapons and also unlock alternate costumes. Players get honor by reaching a specific score on each stage, collecting the secret scrolls, and completing the special objectives present in each stage. Some of the scrolls are obtained through secret challenges, where the player is transported to a room to solve a puzzle.  Before each mission the player is taken to an upgrade screen, where they can spend their honor in three sections: Techniques (passive upgrades and skills such as new one-hit executions), Distraction Items (such as smoke bombs and firecrackers) and Attack Items (such as caltrops and poison-tipped darts). The next screen allows the player to select any unlocked costumes and equip items. Each costume (except the starting one) gives special bonuses, but also a side effect in order to balance its power, and must be unlocked by completing a number of seals in the form of optional goals related to the specialty of that costume (for instance, optionally terrorizing enemies in specific ways to unlock a costume which improves the ability to terrorize). Completing the game once unlocks a New Game Plus mode where the enemies behave more intelligently and can kill the player with only a single bullet or hand-to-hand strike, the player's line of sight is limited to a cone aimed in whatever direction the player is facing (preventing players from seeing what is behind, above, or below them unless they turn to look), the player is unable to see the enemy's line of sight and must intuit it from the direction an enemy's face is pointed, and the player can no longer detect the radius at which their actions will be heard by enemies.   The game's story begins with an attack by a heavily armed force on the dojo of the Hisomu ninja clan. The unnamed ninja protagonist, resting after receiving an extensive irezumi tattoo, is awakened by a female ninja named Ora. Gathering his equipment, the protagonist is able to defeat the attackers and rescue his sensei, Azai, as well as several other members of the clan. Before being rescued by the protagonist, Azai was being blamed by the attackers, who said ""you picked the wrong people to steal from"". However, Azai simply claimed that the clan has been hidden from the modern world for centuries until now, when ""their enemies finally found them"". Azai tells him about the power of his tattoo and the legend surrounding it, explaining that the ink comes from a special desert flower and grants greatly sharpened senses and reflexes when absorbed slowly into the body, but will ultimately cause one so tattooed with it to descend into madness. In the distant past, the first Hisomu ninja to receive the Mark became incredibly dangerous, but increasingly deranged, leading to a lengthy reign of terror that only ended with his demise. Therefore, to receive the Mark, a ninja swears to commit seppuku once the madness begins to take hold.  After the protagonist receives his second tattoo, he and Ora are tasked to take revenge on the PMCs responsible for the attack on the dojo: a corporation called Hessian, run by a ruthless Eastern European plutocrat named Count Karajan. Meanwhile, the horishi artist Dosan expresses concern over the tattoo ink's quality and promises to learn why Azai has not procured a fresh supply. The protagonist invades Hessian's East Asian regional headquarters and murders Corporal Kelly, the Hessian employee who led the attack on the dojo, and, using a stolen GPS tracking unit, stalks Karajan to his castle in Eastern Europe and slays him. Upon returning home, the protagonist and Ora see that their clan has stolen a great deal of high tech military equipment from Hessian, leaving them to realize that Azai's plan had been to rob Karajan and replace the old Hisomu Path with a modern, technological approach to espionage. Instead of committing seppuku, the protagonist flees with Ora to find Dosan, who had left a message indicating that he had personally gone in search of the mysterious desert flower.  Following his trail, the protagonist and Ora discover that Dosan has been captured by bandits, who are holding him hostage in a war-wracked Middle Eastern city and demanding that he Mark them with his remaining supply of the sumi ink. Upon being freed, Dosan explains that the flowers from whose leaves the sumi is produced have died out, and appear to have been dead at least since the last fresh supply of the ink was taken by the Hisomu clan. As revealed by hidden scrolls recounting the history of the clan, Azai himself had failed to defend the flowers when the devastated region to which they were endemic was taken over by vicious bandits. Thus dishonored, but for the sake of the clan's survival, Azai hid his failure and had planned the Hessian heist in order to supply the Hisomu with cutting-edge equipment now that the unique source of their strength had been extinguished. Finally, he ordered that the last of the sumi ink be used to Mark one final ninja, whose strength would enable the heist and save the clan itself from extinction at Hessian's hands. Dosan uses the remains of the sumi to give the protagonist his final tattoo, shortly before some of Azai's high tech ninja stalkers ambush them and shoot Dosan to death as he and the protagonist attempt to escape.  Having left his equipment behind during the hasty retreat, the protagonist, now obviously hallucinating, uses the almost superhuman reflexes afforded to him by the final Mark to evade death at the hands of both the bandits and the Hisomu stalkers, and travels back to Japan with Ora, who recommends he kill Azai for the dishonor of failing to maintain the traditional Hisomu way. The protagonist uses his almost preternatural abilities to infiltrate past Hisomu-jo's new sophisticated defenses, and confronts Azai in his garden. When Ora arrives and commands the protagonist to slay Azai, Azai claims to be unable to see Ora, and, suggesting that she is a symptom of the protagonist's creeping madness, insists that he satisfy his honor and kill himself before he slips too far beyond reason. Suddenly uncertain, the protagonist is reassured by Ora that Azai is lying to deceive him, and she urges him to murder Azai and purge the dishonorable Hisomu clan who followed him. Upon retrieving the ritual sword, the protagonist experiences a brief psychotic fugue state, in which he symbolically relives the events of his life subsequent to taking on the Mark. He finds himself in a courtyard opposite both Ora and Azai, who kneels and places his own sheathed sword on the ground, awaiting the protagonist's choice.  If the player chooses to kill Azai another psychotic episode follows, in which the protagonist murders his sensei and becomes the maniacal Hisomu tyrant of legend, melting silently into darkness with a swift strike of his sword. If the player chooses to kill Ora, the protagonist disembowels himself with the ritual sword and Ora dissolves into inky nothingness as the Marked ninja sputters his last breath and dies in the courtyard.

633,Mega Man 11,/wiki/Mega_Man_11,Platformer,Capcom,Capcom,"October 4, 2018","October 2, 2018","October 2, 2018"," The story begins with a flashback of Dr. Light and Dr. Wily when they were students at Robot University at the exact moment they had their falling  out. The committee is debating over choosing either Light's research of robots with independent thoughts or Wily's Double Gear system to continue work on. Despite Wily telling Light that they can't build the future on his so-called empty optimism, Light's research was chosen over Wily's because the Double Gear system puts an incredible strain on the robots that use it and could be dangerous in the wrong hands. Angry at being pushed aside and shut down in addition to being blocked by Light at every instance Wily destroys his prototype Double Gear and swears to Light that one day he will show the world and him he was right all along.   After the flashback ends with Wily waking up disturbed (presumably the flashback served as a really bad dream), he suddenly remembers the Double Gear System. He immediately puts his plan into action, swearing revenge on Light.  Meanwhile, at his lab, Dr. Light, Roll, and Auto are checking up on 8 latest generation models of Robot Masters (Block Man, Acid Man, Impact Man, Bounce Man, Fuse Man, Tundra Man, Torch Man, and Blast Man) for maintenance. Just as they finish with Block Man, Wily barges into the lab in his Wily Capsule and tells Light that he has perfected the Double Gear system. Mega Man (who was sweeping off-screen) rushes in to try to stop Wily, when at that moment the Robot Masters show up and Wily decides to use them as test subjects. Before they can escape, Wily uses the Speed Gear mode of his Double Gear to speed up the capsule and snatch the Robot Masters via tractor beam. Mega Man demands Wily to release them, but he takes them to his Fortress to have them reprogrammed and fitted with his upgraded Double Gear Systems.  Just as Mega Man is about to leave to stop Wily, Light stops him and explains what the Double Gear System is and what it's capable of. He then warns Mega Man that if Wily really has perfected it, the latter won't stand a chance, but Mega Man refuses to let Wily get away. Realising that Mega Man won't be stopped, Light reveals that he kept and repaired the prototype Double Gear System that Wily used to own. After briefly warning Mega Man of its potential danger (with Mega Man accepting the risk), Light installs the Double Gear into Mega Man after several days so he can stand a chance against Wily's new army.  After defeating 4 Robot Masters, Light explains to Mega Man that the Double Gear system was partly responsible for him and Wily falling out. Light believed that if robots were given the power to think for themselves, they could be true partners with humans. Wily, however, stated that even robots who think independently would be mere tools to humans, but by giving them power and speed boosts, then humans would finally respect robots for what they are and any robot could be a hero with the Double Gear System installed. However, when the committee chose Light over Wily, the latter stormed off never forgiving his old friend for not even giving him a chance.  Back in the present, Light ponders about his decisions back then, and muses if he had shown him there was a way to work together instead of telling him that he was wrong, they might still have been friends even admitting that the Double Gear System can be used for good if used properly. Light then gives Mega Man the Rush Jet modification for Rush (Mega Man's robotic pet dog) with Mega Man then setting off to defeat the remaining Robot Masters.  After defeating all 8 Robot Masters, Auto attempts to locate Wily. At first, it seemed as if Wily disappeared, when suddenly the lab's signal was intercepted, and Wily himself appeared on the screen. Angered that Mega Man not only defeated the Robot Masters but he also he used his prototype Double Gear System, Wily beckons Mega Man to come to his Gear Fortress so he can deal with him on his own. Mega Man heads out to stop Wily.  After traversing the fortress, (while defeating the Yellow devil MK 3, Mawverne and the resurrected robot masters) Mega Man confronts Wily in his new Wily Machine and the two battle. In the end, Mega Man is victorious, causing Wily to resort to ""Plan B"", which was simply to kneel and beg for mercy. The ""plan"" fails when Mega Man doesn't fall for it, but Wily then mocks him, believing his loss wasn't caused by Mega Man, but rather the Double Gear System, which was his own technology, proclaiming himself as the better genius. Suddenly, Light walks in. Light asks Wily to look at Mega Man and explains that Mega Man holds tremendous power, but is intelligent enough to use it wisely; in a way, he is Light and Wily's ideas combined. Light asks Wily to atone for his crimes and be friends with him again, as before, so they could make other amazing ideas become reality, just like Mega Man. Wily refuses, stating his plans have only begun, and then escapes. Light fears he and Wily may never be able to work together again. As the fortress begins to collapse, Auto arrives, telling Light he had finished doing what he asked of him. With that, the three of them escape the collapsing fortress.  Back at the lab, it's revealed that Light and Auto were at the Gear Fortress to find the parts in order to rebuild the Robot Masters. Auto uses Mega Man's Double Gear System to carry the Robot Masters to the repair room, so they can be sent back to their owners (during which he overheats and faints).   Mega Man 11 retains the gameplay style of the classic Mega Man series of games, and features a 2.5D graphics style with 3D polygonal characters and 2D environments. Players control Mega Man in an attempt to stop Dr. Wily from using the Double Gear system that he invented many years before when he was at Robot University.  Players travel through eight linear stages, which can be chosen in any way the player sees fit, and have to face Doctor Wily's newest Robot Masters, including Block Man, Fuse Man, Blast Man, Acid Man, Tundra Man, Torch Man, Impact Man, and Bounce Man.   Mega Man can perform classic moves such as the chargeable Mega Buster and slide, as well as obtain new weapons by defeating Robot Master bosses at the end of each level. Unique to this game is the Double Gear system, which grants Mega Man two additional abilities: the Speed Gear and Power Gear. The Speed Gear lets Mega Man slow down time, allowing him to dodge attacks, while the Power Gear increases the attack power of Mega Man's weaponry, allowing him to fire two charged shots at the same time or a single, very poweful charged shot; however, there is a limit, showcased by a bar above Megaman's head, so if Mega Man uses them too much, he will overheat, making him unable to reuse them again for a few seconds. When Mega Man's health is critically low, he can activate both gears at the same time, slowing time and performing a powerful charge shot. This can only be used once and leaves Mega Man weakened after the limit expires: he can't charge his shots, can only fire a single solar bullet at a time and he will only have one unit of life energy, making the next hit he takes fatal for him, and even the cooldown period where he can't use the gears is longer because of the severe strains.  The game has additional features including Time Trials, Missions, Global Leaderboards, a character gallery and more. The game also features difficulty settings, last seen in Mega Man 10, expanding upon them for a total of four: Newcomer, Casual, Normal, and Superhero. The Nintendo Switch version has Amiibo support, which can be used to unlock in-game items.  "

The individual systems of each title are retained in the collection, with the addition of new features such as the ability to play through all games in order as one cohesive story. A new ""Easy Scenario"" mode decreases the overall difficulty of every title by granting many power-up items and abilities from the beginning, which saves the player from having to obtain them through normal means. Players may also map the game's controls to accommodate for the Nintendo DS's two extra buttons compared to the Game Boy Advance.  Primary gameplay takes place of the top screen of the Nintendo DS, while the extra bottom screen displays static artwork relevant to the portion of the game the player has reached. During a boss fight, for instance, concept artwork of the enemy will appear on the bottom screen throughout the battle. All art collected in this way becomes available for viewing in the game's Gallery menu. The original Game Boy Advance aspect ratio is preserved on the marginally larger Nintendo DS screens by placing a black border around the gameplay area in each title.   "

640,Megadimension Neptunia VII,/wiki/Megadimension_Neptunia_VII,Role-playing,Idea Factory,JP,"March 19, 2020","July 28, 2020","July 28, 2020"," The game features a new battle system with a different combo structure to previous games, although some similarities still exist. The gameplay places strong emphasis on the positioning of characters. Each goddess character has a ""Next Form"", which is an additional transformation phase on top of their existing goddess transformations; these forms cause changes to combat style, in addition to character personality changes. Battles are a four-member party ""Unit Turn-based"" system.  When it becomes the player's turn, they can select a character and move freely within the battlefield.   The game is separated into three individual chapters with different stories for each dimension, each with a unique title:  Zero Dimension Neptunia Z: Twilight of the Desperate CPU  With the era of peace continuing throughout the world of Gamindustri, Neptune, the ruling Console Patron Unit (CPU) and Nepgear, her sister and CPU Candidate of the nation of Planeptune resume their lives of laziness despite warnings from their Oracle, Histoire. She warns them that the world is entering the 'CPU Shift Period', where the public will attempt to discredit and oust their CPUs in favor of newcomers. However, before Neptune and Nepgear can prepare properly, they stumble across an old video game console which, when activated, transports the pair to an alternate dimension; the Zero Dimension.  Upon discovering this new dimension is a ruined wasteland inhabited only by monsters, the two are surprised to find a survivor, Uzume Tennouboshi, who is also a CPU. Neptune and Nepgear learn that, like Uzume, they are unable to transform to unlock their true powers in this world due to the absence of Shares (faith from the people) and so the trio journey across the land to locate fragments of power known as Share Crystals which they use to empower themselves enough to reclaim the land from the invading monster hoard.  Neptune and Nepgear learn from Umio, Uzume's sentient fish-monster friend, that Uzume has unique abilities that may trigger when the party needs them most. She is also an amnesiac who remembers nothing of her people or the calamity which destroyed her world but believes it to be the work of a giant known as Dark Purple. Uzume's abilities soon begin to benefit the party by granting them Shares from friendly monsters, food, and finally the ability to seal Dark Purple in a pocket dimension; the Sharing Field, where the party are able to defeat her.  Nepgear begins repairs on a transportation device to send herself and Neptune home but the facility is attacked by Arfoire; a powerful CPU-like being with a lust for destruction. Neptune was successfully transported home, but Nepgear, out of reflex, jumped out to help save Uzume from Arfoire's forces. This led the two to abandon their post and retreat. Back home, Neptune finds Histoire incapacitated due to her being an artificial life-form who overloaded as a result of her linking the two dimensions to bring Neptune home. With intel from the other CPUs, Neptune sets out to find an ancient artifact belonging to the original CPU of Planeptune which can reboot and upgrade Histoire. Neptune acquires the artifact from a hidden dungeon and begins to restore Histoire, hoping she can bring Nepgear home.  Meanwhile, in the Zero Dimension, Nepgear and Uzume attempt to regroup at Uzume's base but are intercepted by Arfoire. Fortunately, the two are able to defeat and capture her with assistance from an alternate, older Neptune. The older Neptune reveals that she is a dimension traveler who comes from a Planeptune under the rule of Plutia (a close friend from the previous game, who rules in another dimension, the Ultra Dimension) who came to the Zero Dimension with the power of Croire (a dimension-crossing antagonist, also from the previous game) after capturing her, though Croire has since escaped.  Arfoire manages to escape by manipulating the party and tracks down Croire, resulting in a formidable new alliance. The party are unable to defeat Arfoire who has stolen power from Croire to boost her own, but successfully recaptures Croire. With her enhanced abilities, Arfoire frees Dark Purple from the pocket dimension and fuses with it, though the party are able to re-confine the fused deity by boosting Uzume's powers with Planeptune's shares, creating a cross-dimensional portal in the process. Neptune rejoins the party through the portal and aids the group in destroying the giant deity, though the portal's temperamental nature causes Neptune and Nepgear to return home after the battle, and a heartwarming farewell to their new friend Uzume. Uzume and Umio plan to rebuild their world, though the older Neptune's fate is left uncertain.  Hyperdimension Neptunia G: The Golden Leaders, Reconstructors of Gamindustri  Several days later, the CPUs hold a meeting to discuss the CPU Shift Period which is now in full effect. Vicious slander pollutes the media and internet regarding the CPUs, resulting in Shares disappearing at an alarming rate. The CPUs agree to work together to unite Gamindustri and regain public faith by hosting a week-long festival. The festival proves largely successful until the final day when the CPUs hold a friendly battle tournament. The tournament is interrupted by a mysterious 4-person group known as Gold Third who challenges and swiftly defeats the CPUs. After their humiliating defeat, the world is engulfed in an ominous white light.  The CPUs awaken several days later in their respective nations, only to find that the public have forgotten them and each of the four members of Gold Third now rule the four nations. The CPUs each return to their respective Basilicoms (CPU Headquarters) followed by the CPU candidates to assess each nation's situation. Though they attempt to keep in contact by cell-phone, networks prove unstable. Vicious new monsters have also been reported throughout Gamindustri, as well as four mysterious golden towers.  Neptune:  Neptune reunites with her old friend IF; a guild agent, and follows her on a mission investigating a mysterious new crime syndicate known as AffimaX. IF attempts to abandon Neptune having forgotten her entirely, though her memories return when Neptune rescues her from Arfoire who is revealed to have survived and escaped from the Zero Dimension. The two friends defeat Arfoire, however she is rescued by Steamax; a cyborg ninja from AffimaX. The two return to Planeptune as a handful of citizens regain their memories, including Neptune's other friend Compa; a local nurse. The three head to the Basilicom where Histoire welcomes them home and reveals that B-Sha from Gold Third is an even lazier leader than Neptune, and is also afraid of monsters.  Histoire suggests Neptune and B-Sha rule Planeptune together, with B-Sha policing the city and Neptune slaying the growing number of monsters outside. Later, the party capture the mouse-mascot Warechu; an AffimaX thief and video-game pirate, who is interrogated for information on AffimaX. In an effort to woo Compa, Warechu reveals the names of several AffimaX members, including himself, Arfoire, Steamax and their leader, the capitalist General Affimojas. Steamax infiltrates the Basilicom, frees Warechu and steals Neptune's dimension-crossing console (assumed to be a Dreamcast). The party chase after and defeat Steamax, but are forced to join forces with him to stop a brainwashed Warechu and B-Sha who are attacking Planeptune, though Steamax escapes with the Dreamcast after the battle.  Noire:  Noire returns to Lastation with her sister Uni only to find she is a wanted criminal. Noire is forced to leave Uni behind and run from her pursuers until she collapses from exhaustion at the capital. Fortunately, Noire is rescued and nursed back to health by a girl named K-Sha. The two become best friends and K-Sha reveals Lastation's Gold Third leader resigned and a corrupt mercenary group called The Order is now in charge of Lastation. Noire tries to aid Lastation by defeating the new monsters which are attacking civilians but risks capture by being in the public eye. Eventually, Noire is tracked to K-Sha's location and K-Sha is interrogated to reveal Noire's whereabouts. Noire surrenders to save her friend, though Uni soon arrives and breaks Noire out of jail. The two return to K-Sha, who becomes increasingly jealous of Noire's close relationship with her sister.  Steamax, under the name 'Jiro', meets Uni for the first time and takes a liking to her. After a mysterious voice persuades K-Sha to remove Uni from their relationship, K-Sha challenges Uni to a fight to the death at the golden tower, with Noire being the prize. At the tower, K-Sha reveals the truth that she is Lastation's Gold Third member and is also in love with Noire. Noire takes Uni's place in the dual to spare Uni and wins, sparing K-Sha, resulting in the two agreeing to be friends. Later, the tower is attacked by The Order, hoping to cut off K-Sha's power source; the crystal on the top floor. The three defeat the order but Uni is poisoned by a chemical weapon. K-Sha saves Uni's life by creating a vaccine from her own blood, but turns hostile again afterwards and is defeated once again. Realizing her power is driving her insane, K-Sha destroys the crystal herself and the three agree to try being friends again.  Blanc:  In Lowee, Blanc is rescued from a monster by C-Sha of Gold Third. C-Sha claims she has no memory of their prior battle and tells Blanc about the harsh class system in Lowee and the restrictive travel and employment laws. Blanc joins C-Sha and becomes a hunter and helps the struggling citizens whilst searching the land for her sisters, Ram and Rom. C-Sha is approached by a politician named Azna=Leb and tasked with assassinating Blanc, but she refuses. After reuniting with Rom and Ram on a rescue mission, Blanc is approached by Azna=Leb and tasked with investigating C-Sha following troubling allegations against her. Blanc questions her friend and C-Sha apologetically reveals the truth, that she is the Gold Third leader of Lowee and is the source of the monster outbreak as her powers randomly release an uncontrollable red mist which summons monsters against her will.  C-Sha is arrested by Azna=Leb's agents despite Blanc's protests of her innocence. C-Sha is sentenced to execution but releases the red mist which summons an army of monsters to attack Lowee, allowing her to escape with help from her friend Financier. Ram and Rom evacuate the citizens whilst Blanc attempts to stop the monsters alone. When all hope seems lost, Financier arrives with reinforcements in the form of Ram, Rom, C-Sha and the Hunters Guild. After liberating Lowee, C-Sha reclaims her position of ruler and arrests Azna=Leb who she left in charge in her absence, and then abolishes the harsh laws and class system which he set in place. Afterwards, C-Sha climbs her golden tower and destroys the crystal at the top to remove her powers and the red mist, but instead becomes possessed by the mist. After Blanc, Ram and Rom defeat her, the four return to their duties in Lowee.  Vert:  Vert, the CPU of Leanbox, returns home to learn from the new leader, S-Sha of Gold Third, that Leanbox is under attack by outside invaders as well as an army of demons. Vert immediately joins the military in order to save Leanbox and is sent to the front lines where she learns that Leanbox's entire army has been wiped out by a curse that turns them into pigs. After defeating an outside invader; a battle robot believed to be from Lastation, Vert is dispatched to defeat another invader but instead encounters Nepgear who offers her support. Together, the two defeat another battle robot which Nepgear reveals that whilst it was made from Lastation parts, it was actually built within Leanbox.  The two return to S-Sha to suggest an internal rebellion but S-Sha cold-shoulders them. Later, Vert is contacted by a woman named E-Sha who begs her to stop S-Sha's scheme. S-Sha promises to return Leanbox to Vert after they defeat the demon king, but she disappears soon after the mission is accomplished. The party follow her to Leanbox's golden tower which is revealed to be the source of her power. The party battles through S-Sha's allies, including older Neptune who reveals she has joined AffimaX. E-Sha manifests as an alternate personality within S-Sha's body which S-Sha intends to create a new vessel for by sacrificing a million cursed Leanbox citizens. Older Neptune causes the ritual to fail by misplacing a pig and the party is able to convince S-Sha to live in harmony with E-Sha after defeating her in battle.  Finale:  With the nations now at peace, Neptune journeys with IF and Compa to reunite the CPUs. After recruiting Nepgear, Vert, Noire, Uni, Blanc, Ram and Rom, the party return to Planeptune to plan their next move against AffimaX. The party learn the location of AffimaX's base of operations; an aerial fortress, which they successfully infiltrate. AffimaX, however, is disbanded, as Affimojas refuses to hand the Dreamcast over to Arfoire, resulting in her leaving with older Neptune. Affimojas also dismisses Steamax having learned of his feelings for Uni, though Steamax stays behind to defend his oldest friend from the CPUs, but is inevitably defeated. Affimojas is able to fend off the CPUs but is then defeated by them when they transform into their 'Next Form'; a new power given to them by Gold Third.  Heartdimension Neptunia H: Trilogy Finale: Into Legend  After returning to Planeptune with Affimojas and Steamax in tow, a giant wormhole opens above Gamindustri. The four CPUs manage to safely explore the wormhole by navigating an extra-dimensional maze, followed from a distance by a worried Nepgear and Uni. After noticing an incoming monster hoard which Neptune recognizes from Zero Dimension, she stops their advance by destroying the passageway with an explosive. Suddenly, Uzume appears and summons Dark Purple, who then abducts the four CPUs. Nepgear and Uni witness the event and return to Histoire to plan a rescue mission. Histoire reveals that the CPUs were taken to the Zero Dimension but the party should be able to follow by using the Dreamcast since the passageway was destroyed earlier. After sparring with Nepgear, Uni, Ram, Rom, Compa and IF, the four members of Gold Third agree to join the rescue mission.  In Zero Dimension, the party interrogate Uzume who denies any knowledge of abducting the CPUs and joins the party to aid in the investigation. Umio reports an anomaly to the northeast where the party find Uzume's doppelganger who reveals her plan to fuse the Zero Dimension and the Hyper Dimension (Neptune's reality) by using her four golden towers as an anchor point, which would plunge the new world into ruin and despair. She then escapes to a third dimension; Heart Dimension, by opening a portal. The party follow her through the portal where they find a fragmented world made from memories and dreams. Nepgear, Uni and Uzume leave the party to rest whilst they explore the area and rescue older Neptune from Arfoire, and destroy her once and for all.  Older Neptune reveals she was a double-agent who joined AffimaX to aid the party from the shadows by stopping S-Sha's ritual and leaving the doppelganger's portal open. The doppelganger, who older Neptune refers to a 'Kurome', ordered Arfoire to kill her after learning the truth. With older Neptune back in the party, the group explores Heart Dimension and learn that Kurome has the power to induce both nightmares and false happiness, which she is using to corrupt the CPUs like she did previously to Affimojas and Gold Third. She also partially re-wrote the timeline to make the public forget, and thus weaken, the CPUs, but newly acquired Shares are cancelling its effects. The party witness the CPUs' fantasies; with Neptune wanting praise and her nation's happiness, Noire wanting to be a successful voice-actress and socialite, Blanc wanting large breasts and Vert wanting younger sisters who are actually clones of herself.  The party track down Kurome, who reveals she is a spirit of the real Uzume; an old CPU of Planeptune who volunteered to be sealed in Heart Dimension by Histoire after unintentionally harming her people having failed to control her powers. There, she came to resent humankind who shunned her and became a wandering spirit, whilst a fragment of her power; her conscience, took on a new life in the connected Zero Dimension, as the new Uzume. Kurome then unleashes the corrupted CPUs on the party who attempt to kill their own sisters but, after an intense battle, Uzume succeeds in cancelling out Kurome's mind-controlling negative energy with Share energy. Kurome reveals that Uzume's growing power also increases her own, allowing her to physically manifest in the Hyper Dimension, leaving the party to battle her latest giant; Dark Green, who they successfully manage to destroy, along with several CPU clones.  A flashback reveals that Umio is a reincarnation of the old Uzume's lover, though he retains no memories of this. The CPU candidates and Gold Third follow Kurome to Hyper Dimension whilst the CPUs, IF, Compa and older Neptune remain in Heart Dimension where they attempt to defeat Kurome by destroying her 'heart' with Share energy. Croire intervenes and summons Dark White to destroy the CPUs, though the party emerges victorious and re-captures Croire. The Hyper Dimension party are attacked by Kurome in an attempt to seize the Dreamcast, which she reveals contains another fragment of Uzume's soul, though the party defeat Kurome's Dark Black CPU and chase Kurome back to the Heart Dimension. There, the two parties regroup to attack Kurome head-on, though Kurome fuses with all four Dark CPUs to become Dark Orange; the ultimate Dark CPU, who is now powerful enough to disable Uzume's Sharing Field.  Uzume is able to reopen the Sharing Field by draining power from the original Share Crystal; her and Kurome's life-force. The party successfully destroy Dark Orange in the Sharing Field, though Kurome orders her monsters to destroy Hyper Dimension before disappearing. With Hyper Dimension facing annihilation, Uzume orders Nepgear and Neptune to destroy the original Share Crystal, which will erase herself, Kurome, Zero/Heart Dimension and the monster hoard. With no alternative, Neptune and Nepgear comply to save their world. Uzume buys the party enough time to evacuate themselves and the friendly monsters, including Umio, back to Hyper Dimension.  Ascension Ending (Normal Ending)  Zero/Heart Dimension disappears and the party return home with heavy hearts. Post credits scenes reveal that the monster hoard never reached Hyper Dimension. Later, Neptune and Nepgear are visited by Uzume's spirit, who promises to always watch over them. This ending was removed from VIIR.  Revival Ending (True Ending)  After Zero/Heart Dimension disappears and the party return home, Histoire reveals that Uzume can be revived with share energy, but there's a chance that Kurome will be revived instead.

All three titles play as tactical role-playing games games, playing similarly to the Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre series of games. The player directs a team of characters across a grid to battle a computer-controlled opponent team in turn based combat. In a character's turn, the player makes decisions in regards to moving a character on the grid within their movement range, and potentially attacking opponents if any are within the attack range. Damage is affected based on characters' proximity to one another and the overall map of the grid. Effectiveness of attacks are determined by a character’s attack power against the other character's defense, all of which are altered based on character's base stats, and alteration of said stats based on equipping items and changing classes of characters in the game's menus prior to starting battles. Successful attacks earn experience points and skill points, which in turn help characters level up and strengthen their stats, while ""mana points"", which are slowly accrued over the course of battle, are used in order to use more powerful attacks mid-battle. If a character loses all of their health through being attacked, they faint, and after 5 rounds of turns, they are removed from the specific battle and unable until the next battle. The game is won if the player makes the entire team fainted or removed from battle, and loses if the same happens to them.  The three titles combined contain 82 specific story-based battles, along with more optional battles as well.  "

It is then that a supposed ""Western Hero"" appears and gives a scroll to one of the surviving ninjas, appointing him as ""The Messenger"" and telling him to deliver it to the top of a mountain. During his journey, the Messenger is aided by a mysterious blue-robed shopkeeper who provides him with upgrades and a demon named Quarble who helps to save him from death. After traveling through various areas and meeting a variety of foes turned friend, the Messenger arrives at the Tower of Time and encounters more blue-robed figures, who send him 500 years into the future to defeat the Demon King's general, Barma'thazël. Upon doing so, the Messenger loops around the world to the ninja village, where he, having reached the point of a cycle where he becomes the Western Hero himself, passes the scroll onto a new Messenger and takes up the role of a shopkeeper providing him with upgrades.  When this new hero ends up dying due to the previous shopkeepers negligence, however, the blue-robes aim to break the cursed cycle, tasking the Messenger with collecting the notes of a mysterious music box in the Tower of Time. After the Messenger succeeds in this task, defeating the Demon King in the process, it is revealed that the music box is the prison of a man known as the Phantom who had become inflicted with a curse and created the time-traveling scroll in an attempt to stop it. This resulted in a 500-year-old mission passed down to several Messengers from various eras. Venturing inside the music box, the Messenger finds the Phantom, defeats the curse possessing him, and rescues him. The curse breaks loose, but the Messenger and the blue-robes team up together to destroy it, putting an end to the curse.   The Messenger is a side-scrolling action-platformer, inspired by the classic Ninja Gaiden series. Players control a ninja known as ""The Messenger"" as he goes on a quest to deliver a scroll. The Messenger initially possesses a technique called ""Cloudstepping"", which allows him to perform an extra jump in mid-air after attacking an enemy, object, or projectile. As the game progresses, the Messenger gains new abilities such as climbing walls, gliding in the air, long-range shuriken attacks, and using a grappling hook to propel himself through obstacles and enemies. By collecting Time Shards earned by defeating enemies or hitting lamps, the player can purchase additional upgrades such as health bonuses or extra attack moves. If the player dies, however, a demon named Quarble will appear and automatically claim any Time Shards the player collects as payment for a short amount of time.   The game initially presents itself as a linear level-based adventure split across two eras; the past, which is presented with 8-bit graphics and audio, and the future, which uses 16-bit presentation. Later on, however, the game becomes a Metroidvania-style game, in which the player revisits past eras in any order and direction in order to find key items. In this section of the game, the player can use special warps to instantly move between the past and present, instantly changing the layout of each level and allowing them to access new areas. Hidden in some areas are green medallions, earned by completing a challenging platforming section, with a bonus unlocked for collecting all 45.  "
645,Metal Max Xeno Reborn,/wiki/Metal_Max_Xeno_Reborn,Role-playing,Kadokawa Games,Kadokawa Games,"September 10, 2020",Unreleased,Unreleased," Metal Max Xeno takes place in the former location of Tokyo Bay, now a desert referred to as Distokio by its inhabitants, approximately a century after the ""Great Annihilation"" in which the supercomputer NOA attempted to destroy humanity in order to prevent further ecological disasters. NOA is eventually defeated, but with its final moments it sends an order to its creations, colloquially known as ""SoNs,"" to completely exterminate humanity, thus beginning a second genocidal campaign. The SoNs quickly began to overwhelm and destroy the remaining settlements in the Distokio area, the only surviving sanctuary being the Iron Base, a secret technologically advanced underground bunker located at the previous site of a post-apocalypse city known as Iron Town, currently occupied by four individuals: D'Annunzio, the base manager, Jingoro, the head mechanic, Yokky, Jingoro's alcoholic protege, and Po-M, an android logistics officer.  Iron Base is visited by a young man (the player character, default name ""Talis""), who has a metal arm and who announces his intentions destroy the SoNs with his tank in revenge for their attack on his hometown and subsequent deaths of his mother and adopted father. The citizens of Iron Base agree to help him, in exchange for his assistance in seeking out survivors from the surrounding settlements. Talis finds no survivors in the ruined settlements, but, following an encounter with a large spider-like SoN, he rescues Toni, a former resident of Iron Town and the crush of Yokky, who had believed her to be dead.  Yokky joins Talis in searching for survivors and the two encounter Dylan, the former leader of a bandit gang that had harassed Iron Town in the past, and save him from a tank hacked by the SoNs. He is taken back to the Iron Base, where he is reluctantly allowed to stay and recover, and Toni joins Yokky and Talis as they travel north to locate new survivors. The three encounter Misaki, an academic who wanders the desert in a Flakpanzer Gepard searching for lost knowledge from before the apocalypse, and with their help he locates the entrance to a massive underground book repository guarded by Maria, the last surviving member of the repository's staff. After Talis assists Maria in destroying a group of SoNs besieging the repository, they, along with Misaki, move the books to Iron Base for safekeeping, and Maria and Misaki, along with a newly-recovered Dylan, join the Iron Base as new residents.  Following the operation, the team gathers for a small celebration. Yokky, noticing Talis' absence, excuses himself to search for him, and finds him in the midst of a painful seizure. While trying to assist him, Yokky discovers Talis' body is almost completely cybernetic; Talis confides to him that it is the result of nanobots which allow him to use his metal arm as a weapon and heal damage to his body quickly, but at the price of him being turned into a machine by the nanobots, and that eventually he will no longer be ""himself."" Talis asks Yokky not to reveal his secret to anyone, but Toni overhears and becomes concerned for Talis, as she has begun to develop feelings for him. The next morning, Po-M reveals that data recovered from the library indicated the existence of ""Cherbourg,"" a massive defense shield that could protect Iron Base from SoNs attacks. Cherbourg was being developed by an underground society called U-Tokio, but U-Tokio was destroyed following a failed operation to retake sectors of the surface from the SoNs, and Cherbourg was left uncompleted, its components scattered across the ruins of Distokio and U-Tokio. With Cherbourg, Iron Base would be able to adequately defend itself against attacks and rebuild Iron Town, so Po-M tasks Talis with recovering Cherbourg's components so that they may complete it.  As they begin the search, they encounter an enormous SoN that Talis recognizes as the one that killed his mother and destroyed his home town. In a blind fury, he attacks it, but is defeated by a massive blast from the SoN and is brought back to Iron Base. Po-M nicknames the SoN ""Catastropus"" and identifies it as the one responsible for the destruction of the other settlements in Distokio, but warns that it is too powerful for Talis to confront at his current strength. Talis, frustrated, asks if there is anything to help him get stronger, to which Po-M has a possible solution in the form of Nephilim Technology: SoNs technology that was recovered and reverse-engineered by U-Tokio before its destruction, far more powerful than conventional weapons. Cherbourg is also NephTech, so she gives Talis a device that can detect its pieces, along with other components of NephTech weaponry to assist him in battle.  While searching U-Tokio's tunnels for components of Cherbourg, Talis discovers a girl with a tail floating in a preservation chamber. Upon waking, the girl, named Ittica, goes with Talis back to Iron Base, and later reveals that she is a genetically-engineered human-animal hybrid called a ""Mute"" which possesses the ability to shapeshift. Once all the components to Cherbourg are gathered, the team returns to base to assemble it. Toni confesses her feelings for Talis, but Talis turns her away, stating that he is aware of Yokky's feelings for Toni and is unwilling to betray him, and reveals to her the extent of his body's conversion by the nanobots, stating that he does not have much time left. Yokky hears the conversation and, realizing Toni is in love with Talis, becomes conflicted about his self-confidence.  Cherbourg is assembled, and successfully tested, but the test attracts the attention of the SoNs. Realizing that the SoNs are now aware of Iron Base's power, they track the source of the attacks to an abandoned military fortress formerly used by U-Tokio, now being used as a staging point and resource stockpile by the SoNs, including the Catastropus itself, which they realize has set its sights on the upgraded Iron Base. After shutting the fortress down to prevent the SoNs from using it, they return to Iron Base to prepare their next move. Yokky and Toni, with the assistance of Maria and Ittica respectively, come to terms with their feelings and insecurity, and the citizens of Iron Base steel themselves in preparation for the final battle.  Aware that Catastropus is now en route, the team forms a plan: With Cherbourg in place, the Catastropus will be preoccupied attempting to break through it, and will leave itself unguarded for a close-range attack carried out by Talis and his team. With his team, Talis breaks through the Catastropus' vanguard and destroys the Catastropus itself, avenging his family and the people of Dystokio. Following the battle, Talis makes preparations to leave and seek out more survivors. Yokky joins him, and after getting a farewell from the citizens of Iron Base and a promise that they will always be a home for them to return to, the two depart in the tank Talis originally arrived in.  After the credits, Talis and Yokky encounter Toni, who wishes to join them. After a moment of consideration, Talis smiles, and accepts her into the team.  After the game, the player has the option of starting a New Game Plus in two different modes: Story Mode, which replays the story with all player progression and items but locking certain plot-related vehicles and equipment, and Hunter Mode, which allows the player to start with all progression, vehicles, and equipment while minimizing the story, allowing the player to focus on hunting monsters and collecting bounties.

647,Metro 2033 Redux,/wiki/Metro_2033_Redux,First-person shooter,4A Games,JP,"April 23, 2020","February 28, 2020","February 28, 2020"," Metro 2033 is a first-person shooter video game. It is predominantly set within the tunnels of the Moscow Metro and Metro-2 system, though some sections take place on the surface, in the ruins of Moscow. The story is told through a linear single-player campaign, and important plot moments are shown during cutscenes.  The human and mutant enemies can be killed with a variety of firearms. The game features traditional guns like revolvers and shotguns, as well as more inventive weapons like a pneumatic crossbow. In firefights, human enemies take cover and flank the player, while mutant enemies stay in the open and try to bite them. Alternatively, the player can employ stealth to evade their enemies or kill them silently. This can be achieved by using a throwing knife to kill an enemy from afar, or shoot an enemy with a suppressed weapon. If the player is shot or bitten while in combat, they can either wait for their health to recharge, or use a med-kit to heal themselves immediately.  The player often has little ammunition, and must scavenge for bullets and other useful items from the bodies of dead enemies or from caches. Pre-war 5.45×39mm ammunition (referred to in the game as ""military grade ammunition"") can also be found, which serves as the currency within the tunnels. The player can either spend military grade ammunition on new weapons, or use it in firefights, which inflicts more damage on enemies than normal bullets. As most of the tunnels feature little to no light, the player can use a flashlight to explore dark areas. In addition to the dimly lit tunnels, some areas, including the entire surface, are covered in radiation, and require the use of a gas mask. If the player engages in combat while wearing a gas mask, it may become damaged and crack, forcing the player to find a functional gas mask.  Throughout the game, there are certain moral choices that can be made. If the player is compassionate to the people living in the tunnels, such as giving the homeless some military grade ammunition, they may be able to watch a different cutscene at the end of the game. These moral choices are never explicitly mentioned, and it is possible to play through the game without knowing of their presence.   This game is based on Dmitry Glukhovsky's book Metro 2033. In 2013, nuclear war had devastated the Earth, wiping out billions of lives. Among the affected nations is Russia, including the now-desolate wasteland of Moscow. A handful of survivors manage to hide in the Metro system, salvaging spare parts and growing mushrooms for food. Animals such as rats, bears, and others are mutated into horrific monsters, while the air in many areas that humans breathe becomes heavily irradiated and impossible to survive in without a gas mask. While there is a constant state of war between the Communists and the Nazis both trying to promote their radical ideologies, bandits are stealing, killing and looting in the metro tunnels, even keeping hostages to gain bullets, which are used as currency.  Twenty years later, in 2033, the northern station of VDNKh, now called Exhibition, falls under attack by a group of mysterious creatures referred to as the Dark Ones. Artyom (Russian: Артём), a 24-year-old male survivor born before the bombs fell and the adopted son of the station commander, is persuaded to leave his home there and seek help from the rest of the Metro by Hunter, an elite soldier of the Spartan Order. Hunter gives Artyom his dog tags and tells him to present them to his superiors in Polis, the ""capital"" of the Metro, before disappearing while tracking the Dark Ones.  The next day, Artyom signs on as an escort for a caravan headed to Riga, a neighboring station. Along the way, the crew is incapacitated by a psychic attack, but manage to reach the safety of the station's defenses after an attack by mutants. Afterward, Artyom meets Bourbon, a smuggler who offers to help him reach Polis as he was immune to the psychic attack. The two make their way through several other stations and tunnels, and even up through the very city of Moscow itself, before Bourbon is killed by bandits. A traveler named Khan rescues Artyom promptly after. After escorting Artyom through haunted tunnels and to a station under attack, Khan stays with the survivors and advises Artyom to meet his contact Andrew the Blacksmith, who lives under the control of the Red Line, a Stalinist regime.  With his help, Artyom sneaks out of the Reds' territory but is subsequently captured by their enemies, the neo-Nazi Fourth Reich. Two Spartan Rangers, Pavel and Ulman, rescue him from execution. Pavel later dies in a handcar escorting Artyom out of the Reich, and he is forced to continue alone, eventually coming across a group of survivors trying to stop a mutant horde from reaching Polis. They fail, but Artyom manages to save a boy named Sasha before they escape. In gratitude, the defenders help him reach the surface, and he reunites with Ulman, who takes him to Miller, the colonel of the Order, in Polis.  The governing council ultimately refuses to help Exhibition, but Miller reveals that he has a back-up plan: a missile silo known as D6 that has the firepower necessary to destroy the Dark Ones hive in the Botanical Gardens. To find a way to D6, Miller tells Artyom to meet him at the Moscow State Library to search for a book that may contain a map. Artyom makes his way into the library and eventually is forced to continue alone while avoiding the mutant Librarians. He eventually finds the book and flees with the help of Miller and Ulman. Artyom is recruited as a Spartan ranger, and takes part in an operation to locate and reactivate the command center of the D6 complex. After their success, he and Miller go to install a laser guidance system at the top of Ostankino Tower. After the laser system is installed, Artyom experiences a vivid hallucination induced by a Dark One.  After the hallucination, two endings are possible depending on the choices the player makes throughout the game. In the canonical ending, Artyom allows the missiles to fire, destroying the Dark Ones; only to realize later that they sought peace and the deaths by them were merely self-defense, which was too late by then. The alternate ending gives Artyom the choice to destroy the laser guidance device, citing a last-minute realization that the Dark Ones were actually attempting to make peaceful contact through the hallucinations. This ending is only available by performing various positive acts throughout the game, such as helping out fellow humans and not automatically fleeing the Dark Ones in various hallucinations.  "

As they escape, one of them breaks open a canister, which causes Planet Land to become infested with monsters. The ""Galactic Penal Squad"" contact ""cybernetic peace officer"" Patricia Wagon (voiced by Stephanie Komure), authorizing the use of her Siren Helmet and Pellet Shooter, in order to capture the criminals. Helping her along the way are General Gendarmor, a mechanical armor that can extract her from battles, Ugly Twitching Dog (U.T.D), who can create reload points, and HQ, who are monitoring her actions.   The player controls a cyborg police officer named Patricia Wagon, who has to round up a group of escaped female convicts. The goal of each level is to find all the escaped convicts and return to the exit point as quickly as possible, with each level possessing a Par Time that dedicated speed runners can try and beat. Along with the ability to jump and shoot, Patricia has the ability to push in and out blocks dotted around the stage with her ""Siren Helmet"", using them as platforms or a means to destroy certain enemies. There are also various other types of blocks such as launcher blocks that send Patricia or an enemy in a certain direction and colored blocks that allow the player to change which plane they switch on. During each level, the player has three hearts (called her ""Heart Drive"", in universe), with the player losing one heart if Patricia is hurt by an enemy, comes into contact with spikes or is pushed into the screen by a block change (Checkpoints created allow Patricia to respawn at that point in the case of the latter two). If Patricia loses all three hearts, she will have to start the level over. Throughout the level she can collect floppy disks which restore hearts, either by finding them, or from shooting enemies.  "

653,Minecraft,/wiki/Minecraft,Sandbox,4J Studios,JP,"May 12, 2017","May 11, 2017","May 12, 2017"," Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game that has no specific goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game. However, there is an achievement system, known as ""advancements"" in the Java Edition of the game. is in the first-person perspective by default, but players have the option for third-person perspective. The game world is composed of rough 3D objects—mainly cubes and fluids, and commonly called ""blocks""—representing various materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava. The core gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects. These blocks are arranged in a 3D grid, while players can move freely around the world. Players can ""mine"" blocks and then place them elsewhere, enabling them to build things. Many commentators have described the game's physics system as unrealistic; liquids continuously flow for a limited horizontal distance from source blocks, which can be removed by placing a solid block in its place or by scooping it into a bucket. The game also contains a material known as redstone, which can be used to make primitive mechanical devices, electrical circuits, and logic gates, allowing for the construction of many complex systems.  The game world is virtually infinite and procedurally generated as players explore it, using a map seed that is obtained from the system clock at the time of world creation (or manually specified by the player). There are limits on vertical movement, but Minecraft allows an infinitely large game world to be generated on the horizontal plane. Due to technical problems when extremely distant locations are reached, however, there is a barrier preventing players from traversing to locations beyond 30,000,000 blocks from the center. The game achieves this by splitting the world data into smaller sections called ""chunks"" that are only created or loaded when players are nearby. The world is divided into biomes ranging from deserts to jungles to snowfields; the terrain includes plains, mountains, forests, caves, and various lava/water bodies. The in-game time system follows a day and night cycle, and one full cycle lasts 20 real-time minutes.  When starting a new world, players must choose one of five game modes, as well as one of four difficulties, ranging from peaceful to hard. Increasing the difficulty of the game causes the player to take more damage from mobs, as well as having other difficulty-specific effects. For example, the peaceful difficulty prevents hostile mobs from spawning, and the hard difficulty allows players to starve to death if their hunger bar is depleted. Once selected, the difficulty can be changed, but the game mode is locked and can only be changed with cheats.  New players have a randomly selected default character skin of either Steve or Alex, but the option to create custom skins was made available in 2010. Players encounter various non-player characters known as mobs, such as animals, villagers, and hostile creatures. Passive mobs, such as cows, pigs, and chickens, can be hunted for food and crafting materials. They spawn in the daytime, while hostile mobs—including large spiders, skeletons, and zombies—spawn during nighttime or in dark places such as caves. Some hostile mobs, such as zombies, skeletons and drowned (underwater versions of zombies), burn under the sun if they have no headgear. Other creatures unique to Minecraft include the creeper (an exploding creature that sneaks up on the player) and the enderman (a creature with the ability to teleport as well as pick up and place blocks). There are also variants of mobs that spawn in different conditions; for example, zombies have husk variants that spawn in deserts.  Minecraft has two alternative dimensions besides the overworld (the main world): the Nether and the End. The Nether is a hell-like dimension accessed via player-built portals; it contains many unique resources and can be used to travel great distances in the overworld, due to every block traveled in the Nether being equivalent to 8 traveled in the overworld. The player can build an optional boss mob called the Wither out of materials found in the Nether. The End is a barren land consisting of many islands. A boss dragon called the Ender Dragon dwells on the main island. Killing the dragon opens access to an exit portal, which upon entering cues the game's ending credits and a poem written by Irish novelist Julian Gough. Players are then teleported back to their spawn point and may continue the game indefinitely.  "

It was released as a number of episodes similar to Telltale Games' other games. Players can collect items, solve puzzles, and talk to non-player characters through conversation trees to learn about the story and determine what to do next. Decisions that the player makes affect events in both the current episode and later episodes. However, Minecraft: Story Mode is intended to be a family-friendly title, unlike Telltale's previous games, which tend to carry more mature or emotional overtones (including the death of major characters). As such, the decisions are intended to be pivotal and emotional but not to involve mature imagery or themes. Elements of crafting and building were included in the gameplay which are central to Minecraft. The game includes combat and other action sequences, carried out through both quick time events and more arcade-like controls, such as steering around debris on a road.  "

Each level is a flat depiction of a real city and begins with three train stations. Train stations are represented by different shaped nodes. Players can construct routes to link stations by drawing lines between them; each route has a different colour. Passengers appear at stations, each denoted by a shape that identifies which station they want to travel to. Trains travel along routes taking passengers to their desired stations. Rivers, intersecting train lines and the appearance of more stations and passengers over time causes the transit network to become more complex and difficult to manage. Common-shaped stations can also change their node shape into rarer ones. The game's visual style is minimalist, employing straight lines and bold colours, similar to modern transit maps.  In the ""Normal"" game mode, each station can accommodate a limited capacity of waiting passengers; if the stations become too congested and the threshold is reached, the level ends. Upon failing, players can continue to build their network in the ""Endless"" game mode where stations do not have a limited capacity. To alleviate the network's growth, players earn upgrades each week of in-game time. At each upgrade, the player receives a new train car and a choice among two other random options such as an extra rail line, an extra train carriage, extra tunnels, or an interchange (which increases a station's capacity and allows trains to instantly load/unload passengers). In addition, the transit simulation can be paused at any point to allow for reconstruction and adjustments to train routes. In ""Extreme"" mode lines between stations cannot be adjusted once their position is set.  In 2018 a ""Creative"" gamemode was added, which allows players to create, adjust and add stations in the game. This is grid-based. This gamemode has also given the player almost unlimited train cars, train carriages, tunnels or interchanges.  "

Learning from the king's court magician, Mysticat, about a way to return everyone to normal, Jin goes on a quest to recover five animal orbs from across the kingdom. Upon doing so, however, Mysticat takes the orbs from Jin and uses them to open the gateway to the Dark Realm for his master Lord Xaros, who had been manipulating Nabu to do his bidding.

The player assumes the role of a hunter who embarks on quests to hunt dangerous creatures. A hunter's abilities are determined by the type of armor and weapons that they wear on a quest, as the hunter otherwise has no intrinsic attributes that affect gameplay. All fourteen weapon types from Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate, ranging from swords, hammers, bows, guns, and lances, are included in Monster Hunter Generations, in addition to the new Prowler mode which allows the player to take the role of a Felyne, a sentient cat-like species. Each weapon has different sets of moves and abilities that can be employed while in the field.  Armors grant defensive bonuses to physical and elemental damage, and can boost specific skills and attack types through base attributes and the addition of special decoration gems and talismans. To make a more powerful hunter that can survive against more dangerous creatures, the player takes materials carved from monsters (either slain or captured via traps), as well as materials gathered from the various fields and purchased in village stores, to craft new armor or to craft and upgrade weapons. Defeating more powerful creatures enables even more potent equipment to be crafted, thus creating a gameplay progress through the game's loot system. New in Generations is the ability to transform armor pieces into new gear similar to weapon upgrade paths by upgrading it with materials from broad categories, like bones or ores, and having the ability to upgrade a weapon directly to a more advanced version without the intermediate upgrade steps.  Monster Hunter Generations features new special moves known as Hunting Arts. These moves require the player to wait for the moves to charge up during the course of a hunt before they can be activated. Once ready, the player can activate them at any time, after which they have to wait for them to charge up again before a second use. The Arts have different effects such as dealing massive damage, providing buffs, or healing allies. The game also introduces a system called ""Hunting Styles"". This system adds different attack styles for a weapon. Each weapon type in the game will have four distinct forms. The Guild Style is a balanced and basic style akin to combat in previous games of the series. The Striker Style is less technical but emphasises the use of Hunting Arts letting the player set up three special attacks. The Aerial Style specialises in mid-air attacks allowing players to use monsters as a platform which they can propel themselves off. The Adept Style gives players an opportunity to perform powerful counterattacks after successfully evading a monster's attack. Visually, the game's combat has been described as flashier than previous titles.  The game will have four new signature monsters along with a number of past flagship monsters. Included are what are known as Deviant Monsters, previous monsters from other games in the series that have been said to have mutated and evolved into more powerful forms, which on defeat will yield spoils of combat that can be used to craft high-level equipment. The game features four villages which are non-combat areas for getting quests and communicating with non-player characters. Three villages return from previous titles, and a new village called Bherna has been added. The game includes an improved resource gathering system; resource points on the various areas will have more items that can be acquired before they are exhausted and the player only has to hold down a controller button to continue to collect items instead of pressing the button each time, and once per mission, the player can call a Felyne messenger to take one inventory's worth of goods back to a village to store.

Alongside the returning Fatalities, Brutalities, Stage Fatalities, Friendships and Quitalities, new gameplay features are introduced, such as Fatal Blows and Krushing Blows. Fatal Blows are special moves similar to the X-ray moves in Mortal Kombat X. Like X-ray moves, Fatal Blows deal a large amount of damage, but unlike them, they only become available when a player's health drops below 30%, and can only be performed once per match. Krushing Blows are a special cinematic variation of a given special move, triggered when certain requirements are met, like most Brutalities in the previous game. Also new to the series is a Flawless Block mechanic, which allows for a comeback window after blocking an attack with precise timing. Another returning finisher is Mercy, last seen in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, where the winning player can opt to revive their opponent, giving them a small amount of life.  Mortal Kombat 11 introduces a Custom Variation feature which offers a character customization system similar to the Gear system in NetherRealm Studios' previous DC Comics fighting game Injustice 2, improving over the Variation system featured in Mortal Kombat X. Each character has an initial set of outfits, weapons and moves, which can be further customized by the player. However, unlike Injustice 2, in Mortal Kombat 11 the characters' appearance does not determine their abilities, allowing the players to create custom move lists independently of their character's appearance.

The players are set to fight through side-scrolling, stage-by-stage levels, using guns, melee weapons or their bare fists to take out enemies. When killed, some enemies start convulsing. Players may fill their syringes with the drug from these enemies' corpses, which can then be injected to refill health or to go into berserk mode, which adds strength and speed to the player. The game can be played in single-player or local multiplayer co-op for up to four players, in the classic arcade campaign, survival, and boss rush modes.   Mother Russia Bleeds is set in an alternate 1980s Soviet Union ruled by the Russian Mafia. Four Ruska Romani working for a man named Mikhail make money by street fighting in the slums. In the midst of a bout, government forces raid the operation and kidnap the four 'Gypsies'.  The party wakes up a month later in an underground laboratory built under a government prison, where they have been made guinea pigs for the concoction of an addictive drug called Nekro. They break out of their cell and escape the laboratory, killing all scientists and security in their way, while suffering increasingly intense hallucinations due to the Nekro, which they also depend on to fight through injury, and give themselves monstrous strength.  Determining that the Soviet government is working with the mafia to spread and sell Nekro, the party clears a gang of violent drug-dealing skinheads out of their former home before meeting Vlad - the pacifistic leader of an organized protest group - and defends his people on their way to a rally before parting ways to follow a tip regarding the location of Mikhail.  Mikhail, to the party's disgust and outrage, is working for the mafia under threat of violence against his family, having sold the party out to be used as test subjects. Mikhail escapes, and the party meets back up with Vlad, whose protest has exploded into a city-wide riot after police fired on the protestors. The party fights their way through an army of riot officers and government soldiers, and assaults the Soviet HQ.  They encounter Mikhail, who has lost his arm in exchange for being allowed to appeal to the party one last time to stop fighting. After turning him down, Mikhail leads them into a fight pit where the rich and powerful watch - in seeming obliviousness to the chaos outside - as waves of vagrants, gangsters, and animals mutated by Nekro attack the party for their amusement, only to scatter in hushed horror as the party kills them all. Mikhail, horrified by the violence, and terrified of the mafia's eventual retaliation, commits suicide in front of the party.  The party corners the government leader in his office, only to suffer a final violent hallucination in which horrifying manifestations of their crippling Nekro addiction assault them, threatening to drive them to madness. When the party overcomes their hallucination, they return to reality, only to find that they have brutally murdered the leader.  If the Romani used Nekro to heal themselves during the fight, they die in front of Vlad, their bodies fatally taxed by the extended overdose of Nekro. If they manage to overcome the hallucination without injecting more of the drug, Vlad takes them to the hospital where they recuperate from their injuries. In an epilogue they find that the revolution has overthrown the government, and erected a statue in their honor, having been positioned as 'the face of the revolution' by Vlad, despite the party's discomfort about the violence they committed to accomplish their goal.

Blocks of the same color will connect to each other if touching, and will be destroyed when four or more are connected, which can be used to cause chain reactions. The player has an oxygen meter at the right-hand side of the screen that constantly depletes as the stage progresses — collecting small air capsules found within the stage will replenish 20% of the player's oxygen, while destroying brown ""X-Blocks"" will deplete 20% of his or her oxygen. Unsupported blocks will fall, which can crush the player if under it.  Drill Land introduces five new gameplay modes, themed as ""attractions"" in an amusement park. Upon selecting one, the player can select the difficulty of the stage before progressing to the main game. Completing an attraction will award the player with a stamp, and collecting all five stamps from each ride will allow the player to engage in a boss fight with Dr. Manhole in the middle of the park, which when defeated will unlock the next level. The five gamemodes include; Drill Land World Tour, which has the standard Mr. Driller gameplay, The Hole of Druaga, a parody of Namco's own The Tower of Druaga where the player needs to retrieve a key to open a door, Horror Night House, where the player needs to inject ghost-filled blocks with Holy water, Drindy Adventure, which features traps such as rolling boulders and spikes, and Star Driller, based on the Space Stage in Mr. Driller G featuring flashing ""Star Blocks"" that disappear after a brief moment.

The player assumes the role of a thief, Mr. Shifty, who is attempting to steal a plutonium core from a building secured by many enemy guards. Shifty advances through a linear series of rooms to reach the end of the stage, which is an elevator on all but the last stage. He must either defeat all the enemies in a room to unlock the door to the next, or travel to its exit while avoiding all its hazards.  Shifty's signature ability is ""shifting"", which teleports him a few meters and lets him pass through thin walls or dodge bullets. Shifting is limited: one shift regenerates for every second the player does not shift, but if the meter is depleted by shifting five times without allowing a recharge, the player cannot shift for five seconds. Some rooms have ""shift blockers"" that cannot be shifted into or out of. The player can punch to kill enemies in two or three hits, depending on the enemy. Scattered around levels are various melee weapons and items which kill enemies in one hit; these items may be held or thrown, and break after a few uses (except for certain throwable items).  Enemies carry many different weapons, including shotguns, flamethrowers, and rocket launchers. Any hit from a weapon — or from an environmental hazard such as lasers, mines, or turrets — will kill Shifty and send him to the beginning of the room to try again.  Killing enemies adds to a meter at the bottom of the player's screen, which begins to drain after not killing an enemy for a short time. When this meter is full, the next bullet that comes close to Shifty will activate ""Slow-Mo"". During Slow-Mo, shift recharges almost instantly and time is slowed down for all enemies.   Silent protagonist Mr. Shifty, in radio contact with his superior Nyx, breaches Olympus Tower, the offices of StoneCorp. They aim to steal a dangerous weapon called the ""mega-plutonium"", to prevent its use for nefarious purposes by the evil Chairman Stone. Shifty infiltrates the building's lower floors and locates the mega-plutonium, but it is a decoy and a bomb. Nyx and Shifty, undaunted, decide to continue by killing Stone, who contacts Shifty by radio. Stone is impressed by Shift's abilities and offers him a job, but Shifty ignores him. At the end of the chapter, Stone sedates Shifty with noxious gas in the elevator, saying Shifty should have accepted his offer.  Shifty awakes deep underground in a cell filled with a shift blocker, but punches through the wall to freedom. He fights his way to a computer terminal, where he re-establishes radio contact with Nyx, who guides him to the surface. There, he encounters Stone, who seems to die in a large explosion.  Nyx at first intends to extract Shifty, but they encounter Stone again soon after. Nyx, shocked, orders Shifty to kill him, but Stone disappears. He reveals that he has studied Shifty and used the real mega-plutonium as a power source for a machine that can teleport anything everywhere. Shifty battles through the many obstacles and guards that Stone shifts in his way, finally destroying the machine's core. This causes it to go haywire, shifting objects randomly, before it explodes and dies. Shifty enters Stone's office at the top of the tower, dodges the hail of gunfire from Stone's twin tommy guns, and kills him.  "

Some sections will require the player to complete a series of smaller nonogram puzzles within a time limit and without using ""empty space"" markers or hints.  The story is split into four cases, each with a Detective Rank that starts at F and increases as the player solves puzzles. Scoring enough points raises the rank and unlocks bonus puzzles outside of the main story, with more points awarded for not using hints. Earning an S rank in a case and clearing all of the unlocked bonus puzzles unlocks optional story sequences detailing SCOUT's backstory.  "

A plotless multiplayer mode with custom game option lets players try out new strategies with up to three friends in free-for-all or team-based matches. Skirmish mode also lets players fight against artificial intelligence opponents (computer-controlled).  Before the match, players choose one of several hero characters from 4 mushroom tribes: Shrooms - Rudo or Ayner, Proteus - Marty'O or Cree, Shii'Moris - Stella or Trini, Grims - Pahom or Ankh. Each character has different skills attributable to his specific tribe and applicable to a certain territory or certain buildings. Special abilities bar is filled by the souls of soldiers who die in battles, so the more player fights, the faster he can open one of four unique skills of his character.  There are three types of buildings: villages that produce units, towers that defend a certain radius of territory and forges that create weapons to make the army stronger. Villages can be upgraded three times - the higher the level of upgrade, the more units they fit in and produce troopers faster. Towers can also be upgraded three times, each time increasing their effective radius and rate of attacks. Forges cannot be upgraded. Buildings can be converted into buildings of other types and back.  Players expand their influence on the map by growing armies in the base villages they start from and by capturing neutral buildings or the ones of opponents. There are several winning conditions, different for each match: destroying all the opposing armies by capturing all the buildings on the map; capturing specific buildings faster than the opponents; being first to have the points counted down to zero.

The player can also shoot with either the X or Y buttons. Most enemies in the game must be shot several times to be killed. While standing on an orange launch pad, jumping will send you into the background, or foreground. The gameplay generally remains the same, as this is mainly to make use of the 3D capabilities of the 3DS. The PC version, due to the fact that 3D visuals aren't standard, uses a depth of field effect when it jumps between the background and foreground.  The main levels in the game are put into one of four ""worlds"". The later worlds' levels are only unlockable by defeating a certain number of previous stages. Within each level, there are three objectives. The main and most straightforward—one is simply to get to the end of the stage and collect the Water Sprite. The second objective is to collect all of the golden diamonds for that level. In each one, there are exactly 100 golden diamonds scattered throughout the area. The third and usually most challenging objective is finding and completing the secret ""land"" hidden within each stage. There is a door labeled ""CGA-land"", ""G-land"" or ""V-land"" hidden somewhere in each area, and entering it transports Max to a short, but challenging, secret stage needed to fully complete the game.  At the start of every level, Max is given unlimited ammunition and three hearts. The character will lose one heart every time he runs into an enemy or any obstacle meant to cause him harm. Some obstacles however, like spikes and lava, will instantly kill him. There is also a four-minute time limit (3DS version only) that will instantly end the player's game if the level is not completed within that time.

Along with the ability to slow time, the player can now kick objects or enemies, split their aim between targets and dodge bullets by spinning. The game also features parkour elements such as flips, wall jumps and rolls, which can be used to increase the number of points awarded. Another new feature allows players to kill enemies by ricocheting bullets off frying pans or signs, which also adds to the point total.

Players are given a rank at the end of each level based on their total number of points, which is shared on a global leaderboard.   The game begins with a masked, unnamed, silent protagonist waking up inside a butcher shop owned by a man named Mitch. The protagonist is instructed by Pedro, a floating sentient banana that Mitch is an arms dealer and must be eliminated. Upon escaping the butchery and killing Mitch, the protagonist heads to the district Null, an abandoned community project now home to a man named Denny and his army of bounty hunters. When confronting Denny he flees but reveals that his Sister Ophelia controls the Internet. The protagonist deals with Denny and heads via the sewers to confront Ophelia. After defeating Ophelia, it is revealed that the protagonist has been systematically killing his own family: with Mitch being his father, Denny his brother and Ophelia his sister. Pedro reveals to the player that the protagonist knocked himself unconscious and erased his memory so that he can eliminate his family without guilt. Upon revealing this, Pedro jams itself into the protagonist's ear and tried to have him shoot himself. The final battle is a visual representation of the protagonist's mental struggle to resist Pedro's influence. With Pedro defeated, the protagonist removes his mask, revealing that he was Pedro all along with the banana being nothing but a figment of his imagination.  "

However, Ultimate Ninja Storm allows players to fight in three-dimensional environments, as opposed to the two-dimensional planes in previous games.  One of the new features introduced to the series in Ultimate Ninja Storm is ""Awakening Mode"", a transformation that can be activated when a player loses a certain amount of health during a match. The health requirement for each character differs based on how powerful the transformation is. Once activated, the character gains new abilities, speed, and stronger attacks. A few of the characters in the game gain entirely new movesets after transforming. With the d-pad, players can use preset items during a match that either damage the opponent or provide various status effects like increasing attack power, or lowering the opponent's defense. Players are also able to customize their character's jutsu and select two support characters to use in a match. Returning to the game from previous installments is ""jutsu clash"" mode, which is initiated if both players activate their special attack at the same time. During this mode, both players have to press the corresponding button as fast as possible in order to knock away their opponent. Each character has an ""ultimate jutsu"". If it hits, both players either input button commands, mash a certain button, or spin the analogue stick the fastest during the time limit. If the attacking player wins, the ultimate will hit, typically taking away around a third to a full bar of the opponent's health. If the defending player wins, they will escape without major damage. Each character also has an ""ultimate impact"", where if the player holds down the melee button, the character controlled will charge up a very powerful strike. If it hits, it zooms in on the opponent's face taking a heavy blow in a short, cinematic close-up.  The game includes 25 playable characters, each of which can also be used as a support character during battle. Ten additional support-only characters are available as free downloadable content released over the five-month period that followed the game's release. Additional downloadable content include alternative costumes, and new missions.  The story mode loosely covers the events of the anime up to episode 135. Players are able to explore the Hidden Leaf Village between missions, which acts as a central hub for the story mode, and access more missions.  "

Like the previous games, a player can choose two characters to assist the player character in battle. The assisting characters can aid the playable one with thirteen combos. In the team-attack system, a player can use support characters to charge and attack. The assistants have health bars, losing health when they are hit and becoming unusable when their health bars are depleted. If a player has one support character, they have ten health bars; if a player has two support characters, each has five health bars. Several arenas are interactive, making a player lose a fight if they leave an area.

Ultimate Decision Mode has the option of changing battle difficulties, with higher scores if greater difficulty is chosen.  The game has mob battles, in which the player controls a character who must battle a series of enemies. In this mode, controls from regular fights are retained and the player can transport to another enemy after they defeat one.   Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 begins with the attack of the Nine-tailed Demon Fox of the Konohagakure ninja village while its former leader, Third Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi, tries to stop it. The current leader of Konohagakure, Fourth Hokage Minato Namikaze, faces the masterminds behind the attack: Madara Uchiha and the fox. The story then moves to some time after Ultimate Ninja Storm 2's; the five leaders of the ninja village face Sasuke Uchiha, who intends to kill acting hokage Danzo Shimura.

He changes sides when he allies with the reanimated body of his brother, Itachi, to defeat Kabuto and send his forces to the afterlife.  "

The player controls the titular main character, Dust (Lucien Dodge), as he tries to remember his past. Dust wields a sentient sword, the Blade of Ahrah (Edward Bosco), as his main weapon. Fidget (Kimlinh Tran), the sword's guardian, acts as a companion for Dust and can use magical attacks (such as Spitting on monsters) As the player travels the world, they can acquire power-ups that permanently alter gameplay, such as the ability to double jump or climb to previously unreachable areas or Flying like a tornado.

The game begins with Dust awakening in a forest meadow, approached by a floating, sentient sword known as the Blade of Ahrah. Dust is joined by Fidget, a small flying creature called a Nimbat, who just so happens to be the sword's guardian, and sets out for a small town in search of answers.  Upon arriving in Aurora, the group find the town overrun with monsters. The mayor of the town asks Dust for his help, and he tracks down the leader of the enemies, Fuse. Just before he dies, Fuse reveals himself to be a Moonblood, creatures who are victims of a genocide perpetrated by a man known as General Gaius. Fuse also tells Dust that he played a role in the war at some point. Mayor Bram instructs Dust to speak to a woman in Aurora named Ginger, who may have more knowledge of the Moonbloods. She is revealed to be part of a group of Moonblood sympathizers, a group that was recently found and killed by General Gaius's soldiers.  After travelling into the northern mountains, Dust and Fidget come across an abandoned village, where Ginger and the leader of the Moonbloods, Elder Gray Eyes, are waiting. Gray Eyes reveals that Dust was created by the Moonbloods from two people who perished at the same time: Jin (Ginger's brother) and Cassius (an assassin employed by Gaius). These two were exact opposites; Cassius was purely evil but of great skill with the sword, and Jin was completely innocent and good but incapable of defeating Gaius. Their combination together became the Moonblood's ""Sen-Mithrarin"".  The group then heads to the Moonblood base in a volcanic region to the north named Everdawn Basin, where Dust assists the Moonbloods in fighting back Gaius's troops. Reaching the peak of the volcano, Dust fights General Gaius in a lengthy battle. Eventually, Gaius hangs from an outcrop over a pool of lava, where he tells Dust that Cassius is no longer part of him, then throws himself into the lava. Fidget tries to get the exhausted Dust back up, but he refuses, and is consumed by the volcano.  After the battle, Elder Gray Eyes gives a speech to the remaining Moonbloods, telling them that because of Dust's sacrifice, they can now rebuild and live at peace with the rest of the world. During his dialogue, Ginger and Fidget witness a dust cloud, along with the Blade of Ahrah rising out of the volcano and flying off, suggesting Dust may still be alive, and chase after it in hopes of finding him.

Each of the game's five worlds is presented with its own hub, where each individual level can be accessed. The hubs are levels themselves, with coins to collect and some basic platforming required to reach new areas. Each hub has around five main levels, and a number of additional puzzles to complete. The goal of each of these levels is to collect clovers, which enable Lucky to take back control of the Book of Ages from Jinx. Each level has four clovers to find — one for completing the level, one for collecting 300 coins, one for finding the five letters that spell ""LUCKY"", and one 'secret' clover, which is usually in a hidden area of the level, or by completing a short time challenge.  The levels themselves offer a variety of platforming challenges. Some are 3D arenas with non-linear progression. Others feature 2D side-scrolling. There are also several mini-levels in each world, including Sokoban-style puzzles and mazes where Lucky is trapped in a marble and has to be guided to an exit. Finally, there are several boss fights featuring the Kitty Litter and Jinx.   Super Lucky’s Tale follows Lucky Swiftail, a curious and brave fox on a quest to find his inner strength and help his sister Lyra protect the Book of Ages, inside of which exist entire worlds and characters.

Lucky also meets friends and allies along the way, including misplaced Yetis, Kookie Spookies, a village of farming worms, and other colorful characters, all of whom live inside the Book of Ages and who, without Lucky's help, will fall prey to Jinx and the Kitty Litter's evil machinations.

U iterates on the gameplay featured in New Super Mario Bros. Wii. The objective of each level is to reach the goal flag at the end of each level while avoiding enemies and hazards.  The game can be controlled either using Wii Remotes or the Wii U GamePad, the latter of which allows for Off-TV Play, where the game can be played solely on the GamePad's screen, without the use of a television. Wii U Pro Controller support was added in the 1.3.0 patch.  Up to five players can play simultaneously. In multiplayer, the player using the Wii U GamePad cannot control a character, but instead can interact with the environment, such as putting blocks down that can aid Mario or stunning enemies. As such, in multiplayer, there must be an equal number of controllers, excluding the GamePad, to the desired number of on-screen characters.  Certain game modes also allow players to play Mii characters saved on their console. New to this release is an asymmetric multiplayer experience called Boost Mode. In this mode, the player with the GamePad can aid other players by using the touchscreen to place blocks on the screen or stun enemies. This can be used to assist amateur players and to allow expert players to perform speed runs.  The Koopalings, Bowser, Kamek, Boom Boom, and Bowser Jr. appear as the game's main villains.  Along with returning elements, such as Ice Flowers and Yoshis, New Super Mario Bros. U introduces new power-ups, such as a flying squirrel suit that allows players to glide across long distances or slowly descend down vertical paths and cling to the side of the walls. Baby Yoshis can be carried by the individual players. Each baby Yoshi has a special ability based on its color, such as inflating in midair, blowing bubbles to attack enemies and illuminating dark areas. Some older power-ups also have new abilities; for example, the Mini Mushroom now allows players to run up walls. Unlike the previous New Super Mario Bros. games, which have separate maps for each of the games' worlds, New Super Mario Bros. U features one large map containing all the game's worlds and levels, similar to that of Super Mario World. Some levels have multiple exits that lead to the different areas on the map. The Super Guide, which takes control of the player's character and moves it automatically through a level, is available in case the player has failed a level many times.  The game features a new antagonist named Nabbit, who is chased after stealing a power-up from Toad. Once Nabbit is caught, Toad rewards the item to the player.  The game features two new modes of play, Challenge Mode and Boost Rush. Challenge Mode adds unique challenges, such as clearing levels quickly or earning as many 1-UPs in a row as possible without touching the ground. The Coin Battles from New Super Mario Bros. Wii also return and this time, the player can customize the battles with the GamePad to place the coins and Star Coins on the course.  Boost Rush takes place on an automatically scrolling level which increases in speed as players collect coins, with the goal to clear the stage as quickly as possible. The game originally utilized the now defunct Miiverse, which allowed players to share comments about particular levels with one another.    Princess Peach is held captive in her castle by Bowser, Bowser Jr., and the Koopalings who invade and use a giant mechanical arm to throw Mario, Luigi, and two Toads far away. Mario and friends must now travel across this new land returning to Peach's castle in order to save her. On the way, they encounter seven Koopalings each controlling their own worlds, plus Kamek, Nabbit, Bowser Jr., and many minor monsters like Goomba. By conquering them, they get closer to Peach's castle, which has been transformed into an evil reflection of Bowser. By defeating Bowser, the castle returns to normal.

She meets up with her old friends, including gloomy but intelligent Beatrice ""Bea"" Santello, hyperactive anarchist troublemaker Greggory ""Gregg"" Lee, and Gregg's quiet, modest boyfriend Angus Delaney. Mae also learns that another one of her old friends, Casey Hartley, has mysteriously disappeared.  Mae spends several days exploring Possum Springs and spending time with her friends, but she also begins to have strange and vivid dreams. At the town's Halloween festival, Mae witnesses a teenager being kidnapped by a mysterious figure. The four friends begin working together to figure out what is going on, with Mae's mental health slowly deteriorating with every one of her dreams. After intensive searching, the four stumble across a strange group of cloaked figures in the woods, who chase after them; Mae ends up falling and lapses into a coma.  Mae eventually wakes up and returns to her friends, and she reveals that the reason she dropped out was due to her increasing dissociation from people and the world (it is implied that Mae suffers from some sort of depersonalization disorder), seeing everything as merely shapes. Mae's journal, in which she draws pictures for each major event in the game, was given to her by a doctor to write down her emotions after she bludgeoned a student with a softball bat six years ago as a result of a dissociative episode. Due to this incident, the townsfolk became wary of Mae and caused a financial and emotional strain in her family. As her dissociation worsened at college, Mae mustered up the strength to leave and return home, hoping that being back in Possum Springs would help her return to normal.  Still wounded, Mae decides to venture out into the woods alone to find the group who chased her and the others, only for Gregg, Bea, and Angus to refuse to let her go by herself. The group enter the old mines and meet the mysterious group, who are revealed to be a cult. The cult turns out to be behind the kidnappings of several residents, including Casey, taking those whom they deem useless to society and whom they say will ""not be missed"" into the mines to sacrifice them to a god-like chthonic entity called the Black Goat in hope that the Black Goat will revitalize the economy of Possum Springs. The cult's leader allows the group to leave, threatening them never to tell anyone about the cult – however while riding up the mine's elevator, a member of the group attempts to kill Mae. The others manage to save her and the elevator falls, collapsing the mine and presumably trapping the cult underground.  Depending on who the player interacted with the most throughout the course of the game, Mae will sit down with either Bea or Gregg and talk about the events of the previous night, and all the things that have happened in Possum Springs. The others join them shortly after, and Mae tells them that although they will all be forced to grow and adapt to life as it goes on for better and for worse, they can still enjoy their time together now. The game ends as the four decide to forget about their problems for the time being and have band practice.  "

The player is equipped with a primary weapon that can be upgraded temporarily or for the rest of the level with various upgrades found on the map. The player can pick up special weapons, such as deployable turrets or, more bizarrely, exploding cats. The player is unable to jump but can slide, and is able to use this to take cover against objects in the game world or tackle enemies, leaving them open to an execution. The player can only sustain a few hits, but health is regenerated quickly.

The game also boasts dynamic mid-level events, such as an attacking SWAT team or a helicopter gunship.

Each character has an ability unique to them, adding an additional element to the gameplay.

Secondary sprites or skins can be acquired for the characters played, if the player completes special or secret tasks. The player progresses through the linear level structure until level 7-3, where the final boss, the Nuclear Throne, has to be defeated. After this, the player may choose to loop to the beginning of the game again with a greatly increased difficulty. The user may continue looping indefinitely until death.  The game resets upon death. Except for special weapons acquired in a hidden level and ""crowns"" retained until after defeating the final boss, anything acquired in one playthrough does not carry over to the next.

Weapons utilise different ammo types, with there being bullet, energy, shell, bolt, explosive and melee weapons.

The game puts players in the role of one of eight adventurers, each of whom begins their journey in different ways. Each character comes from different parts of the world, each of which determines their job or attribute. Each character has a unique ""Path Action"" command that can be used when interacting with NPCs that are divided into two categories: Noble, the ability's effectiveness dependent by the character's level or amount of in-game currency, and Rogue, which has a risk of its user losing credibility upon other NPCs. When the player loses enough reputation in a given town, they can no longer use their path actions on any NPCs in that town. For example, Olberic and H'aanit can challenge characters, Cyrus and Alfyn can inquire about certain bits of information that can be used for completion of quests or in the form of hidden items, Tressa and Therion can acquire items directly from NPCs, and Ophilia and Primrose can guide NPCs and use them as guest summons.  The game features turn-based battles, in which the player can attack using different kinds of weapons or elemental attacks, as well as use abilities and items. Playable characters receive a Boost Point at the end of every turn, of which they can store up to five at a time. During their turn, a player can use up to three Boost Points to boost a command, allowing their character to attack multiple times, raise their defense, or increase the potency of an ability. A boost point is not gained the turn after using boost points. Enemies have a shield counter that lowers whenever they are attacked with a weapon or element they are weak against. When the counter is depleted, they enter a stunned state where they can receive more damage and lose a turn.   Set in the land of Orsterra, the Order of the Sacred Flame believed their world was created by thirteen deities before twelve were forced to seal the fallen god Galdera, who refused to relinquish what they created, within the afterworld that can be accessed through the sealed Gate of Finis. The player follows the stories of eight heroes as they journey through Orsterra: Ophilia, a cleric of the Sacred Flame whose pilgrimage brings her into conflict with a cult headed by an apostate named Mattias; Cyrus, a scholar and teacher at the Royal Academy seeking a missing tome of dark arts called From the Far Reaches of Hell that was stolen by Headmaster Yvon and his assistant Lucia; Tressa, a merchant who goes on a journey after acquiring a journal detailing a past adventurer's travels; Olberic, a former knight of the Kingdom of Hornburg seeking purpose after his kingdom was destroyed in an attack by a sellsword named Werner; Primrose, a dancer and former noble seeking revenge against the Obsidians, a criminal organization that murdered her father; Alfyn, a traveling apothecary inspired to take up his trade after a stranger saved him from a fatal disease as a child; Therion, a thief tasked by a noble family to recover a set of dragonstones belonging to them; and H'aanit, a hunter tracking the monster Redeye after it petrified her mentor.  After progressing through all the characters various stories, the heroes' quests become intermingled as Mattias, Lucia, the Obsidians, and Werner are all revealed to have been under the employ of the immortal witch Lyblac. Revealed to be Galdera's daughter, Lyblac orchestrated the acquirement of From the Far Reaches of Hell and the dragonstones, along with the destruction of Hornburg, to unseal the Gate of Finis while using the Obsidians as her personal army to eliminate threats like Primrose's father. Lyblac required Graham Crossford, the man who wrote Tressa's journal and saved Alfyn as a boy, as an ideal vessel for Galdera to gain corporeal form due to his bloodline's ties to the god; Graham escaped from her clutches, but was mutated into Redeye. This forced Lyblac to seek out Graham's only living son Kit to complete the ritual. After tracking down the Gate's location in Hornburg, Lyblac fully resurrects Galdera and is absorbed into him. The eight heroes fight a vicious battle against Galdera, sealing him back into the afterworld and saving Kit, who receives closure with his father's spirit.  "

Using a Daemon increases an affinity meter; reaching 100% raises Kagachi's attack power, while going above 150% begins decreasing his defence.

The player controls Ori, a white guardian spirit, and Sein, who is the light and eyes of the Spirit Tree. Ori can jump, climb, and use other abilities to navigate. Sein can shoot Spirit Flames to combat enemies or break obstacles. Ori is required to interact with their environment as they jump from platforms and solve puzzles. Ori is faced with enemies while making their way to restoring the forest. The player helps Ori collect health cells, energy cells, new abilities, and upgrades. The game world unfolds to the player in the fashion of a Metroidvania, with new abilities allowing the player to access previously inaccessible areas.  In addition to save points scattered in the game, players can create ""soul links"" at any time they choose to serve as checkpoints. However, soul links can only be created using energy cells collected during gameplay; the needed energy is not in abundant supply, forcing players to create them only when necessary. The player can gain ability points to buy various perks and upgrades, such as increasing the damage of Sein's Spirit Flame. These upgrades can be bought anywhere a soul link has been created and if the player has enough ability points to buy the skill they desire. An ability point is gained when Ori collects enough experience by killing enemies, destroying various plants and finding spirit containers and ability cells (which gives Ori an ability point automatically). Each skill must be bought in sequential order from one of three ability trees to allow the next skill to be accessible.   The voice of the Spirit Tree in the forest of Nibel narrates the story of when Ori, a guardian spirit, fell from it during a storm as a newborn and was adopted by a creature named Naru, who raised Ori as her own. A cataclysmic event soon makes all of the forest wither, and Naru dies of starvation. Newly orphaned, Ori is left to explore the forest on their own. After collapsing near the Spirit Tree and being revived by it, Ori later meets Sein (pronounced /saɪn/), a small orb who guides Ori on a journey to restore the forest. Sein tasks Ori with recovering the light of three main elements supporting the balance of Nibel: Waters, Winds, and Warmth.  Ori and Sein come across two beings in their quest: Gumo, the last survivor of the spider-like Gumon clan, who were wiped out by the forest's cataclysm, and whose home supports the Wind element; and Kuro, a giant, shadowy owl who is hostile toward Ori. Gumo initially steals the key to the Water element, but he returns it after Ori saves him from a rockslide. After the Wind element is rekindled, Ori and Sein find Kuro's nest, empty except for a single egg, and they learn the source of her wrath and the forest's cataclysm: when Ori was lost, the Spirit Tree released a flash of light to look for them, which burned and killed all of Kuro's recently hatched offsprings when she was away from her nest looking for food. Determined to prevent this from happening to her yet unborn child, Kuro took away the core on top of the Spirit Tree, which is actually Sein. Without its core, the Spirit Tree could not sustain the three elements, and Nibel lost its balance. Meanwhile, Gumo overhears Ori and Sein's intentions to restore Nibel and uses his clan treasure that stores the light from the Spirit Tree to revive Naru, and takes her to where Ori is.  After the final element, Warmth, is restored in the volcano Mount Horu, Kuro attacks Ori and Sein as the fire from Horu starts to spread. Naru, who had been separated from Gumo, arrives to protect Ori from Kuro. Kuro softens, remembering the pain of losing her children. As the fire spreads and is about to reach her remaining egg, Kuro takes Sein back to the Spirit Tree, which emits a flash of bright light that dissipates the fire and restores the forest, but Kuro is destroyed by the light. Time passes as the forest begins to flourish once more, and Ori watches new spirits being born in the field at the foot of the Spirit Tree. Gumo and Naru watch together from afar, before the latter goes home, where Kuro's last egg now rests, just in time to see it begin to hatch.  "

Though the player cannot control their ship directly, it serves as a fast travel point to access different areas in the game and acts as the player's persistent inventory space. The player can encounter and recruit non-player characters as companions who have their own personal missions and stories. When accompanying the player, the companions act as an aid in combat. Each companion has its own individual skills and special attacks, and it can also develop its own skill specialization. When exploring, the player can bring up to two companions alongside them, while the rest stay on the ship. The player can make numerous dialogue decisions, which can influence the game's branching story. They can also respond to NPCs in various ways, such as acting heroically, maniacally, or moronically.  During combat situations, the player can use various weapon types such as melee and firearms, which have three ammo types: light, heavy and energy. These weapons can be customized to add elemental damage. The player can use stealth or social skills (persuasion, lying and intimidation) to avoid combat altogether. As the player progresses, they gain experience points, which the player and their companions can use to level up and unlock new skills. The player can develop their technical skills, which are further divided into three categories: Science, Medical, and Engineering. For instance, the player can use a shrink ray to shrink down an enemy. The player is able to invest points into these skills, which will unlock new perks that enhance combat efficiency. The player can also enter a ""Tactical Time Dilation"" state, which slows down time and reveals opponents' health statistics, which grants the player tactical advantages. As the player leads their companions, they improve their companions' combat strength and resilience. The player can also gain a ""flaw"" that occurs when the player fails repeatedly in certain gameplay segments. Flaws impede the player in some way, but also give additional perks and advantages.   "
773,Outlast,/wiki/Outlast,Survival horror,Red Barrels,Red Barrels,Unreleased,"February 27, 2018","February 27, 2018"," In Outlast, the player assumes the role of investigative journalist Miles Upshur, as he navigates a dilapidated psychiatric hospital in Leadville, Colorado that is overrun by homicidal patients. The game is played from a first-person perspective and features some stealth gameplay mechanics. The player can walk, run, crouch, jump, climb ladders and vault over objects. Unlike most games, however, the player doesn't have a visible health bar on the screen and is unable to attack enemies. The player must instead rely on stealth tactics such as hiding in lockers, sneaking past enemies, staying in the shadows and hiding behind or under things in order to survive. Alternatively, the player can attempt to outrun their pursuer. If the player dies, the game will reset to the most recent checkpoint.  Most of the hospital is unlit, and the only way for the player to see while in the dark is through the lens of a camcorder equipped with night vision. Using the night vision mode will slowly consume batteries, forcing the player to scavenge for additional batteries found throughout the asylum. Outlast makes heavy use of traditional jump scares and audio cues, which alert the player if an enemy has seen them. If the player records specific events with their camcorder, Miles will write a note about it, providing further insight into his thoughts. Documents can be collected, which offer backstory and other expository  information about the facility,  including pages taken from the diaries of patients and reports from the hospital staff.  Developer Red Barrels have pointed to the survival-focused gameplay in Amnesia: The Dark Descent as a primary influence on the combat-free narrative style of Outlast. Found-footage horror films like Quarantine and REC also served as influences.   Freelance investigative journalist Miles Upshur receives an anonymous email that inhumane experiments are being conducted at Mount Massive Asylum, a private psychiatric hospital owned by the notoriously unethical Murkoff Corporation. Upon entering, Miles is shocked to discover its halls ransacked and littered with the mutilated corpses of the staff. He is informed by a dying officer of Murkoff's private military unit that Mount Massive's deranged inmates, known as ""variants"", have escaped and are freely roaming the grounds, butchering Murkoff's employees. The officer implores him to leave, but Miles finds he cannot return the way he came and must press on.  As Miles searches for an exit, he is ambushed by a hulking variant named Chris Walker, who hurls him through a window into the lobby, knocking him unconscious. While incapacitated, Miles encounters Father Martin Archimbaud, a self-anointed priest with schizotypal personality disorder, who claims Miles is his ""apostle"" and sabotages his escape by cutting off power to the front doors. Miles restores power, but Father Martin injects him with anesthetic. He shows Miles footage of ""the Walrider"", an entity killing patients and personnel alike, which he claims is responsible for the asylum's ransacking.  Regaining consciousness, Miles finds himself trapped in a decaying cell block filled with catatonic and demented patients. He escapes through the sewers to the main wards, pursued by Walker and two cannibalistic twins, only to be captured by Rick Trager, a former Murkoff executive driven insane like the other inmates. Trager straps Miles to a wheelchair and amputates two of his fingers with a pair of bone shears, preparing to do the same to his tongue and genitals. However, Miles escapes Trager and flees to the elevator, inadvertently crushing Trager between floors when he attacks him.  Miles ventures further into the hospital and reconvenes with Father Martin, who tells him to go to the asylum's chapel. Reaching an auditorium, Miles learns that the Walrider was created by Dr. Rudolf Gustav Wernicke, a German scientist brought to the United States during Operation Paperclip. Wernicke believed that intensive dream therapy conducted on traumatized patients could connect swarms of nanites into a single malevolent being.  Miles finds Father Martin crucified in the chapel, who gives Miles a key to the atrium elevator that he insists will take him to freedom before immolating himself. Miles takes the elevator, which descends into a subterranean laboratory. Walker attacks him, only to be eviscerated by the Walrider. Miles locates an aged Wernicke, who confirms that the Walrider is a biotechnological nanite entity controlled by Billy Hope, a comatose subject of Murkoff's experiments. He orders Miles to terminate Billy's life support in the hopes that this will destroy the Walrider. Miles accomplishes this task; however, just before Billy dies, the Walrider attacks Miles and possesses his body. On his way out of the laboratory, Miles encounters a Murkoff military team led by Wernicke, which guns him down. A horrified Wernicke realizes that Miles is the Walrider's new host. Panicked screams and gunfire are heard as the screen fades to black.  "
774,Outlast 2,/wiki/Outlast_2,Survival horror,Red Barrels,Red Barrels,Unreleased,"March 27, 2018","March 27, 2018"," Outlast 2 is a first-person survival horror game that, like its predecessors Outlast and Outlast: Whistleblower, is a single-player campaign. It is set in Northern Arizona. The game continues the found footage characteristics from the first game. The player controls the investigative journalist Blake Langermann, who investigates a dilapidated rural area in Supai, near the western edge of the Colorado Plateau.  Langermann cannot fight except in scripted scenes, but must run and hide from the numerous hostile members of Temple Gate. The player can crouch, run, jump, walk, vault, slide and climb much like the first game and can hide in lockers, barrels, wardrobes, beds, pools of water, tall grass, cornfields, and inside of houses. He has a limited stamina meter and the player must manage how long he runs, lest he becomes exhausted and move more slowly.  Langermann possesses only a camcorder, which has night vision capabilities, though the camcorder's batteries are also drained when night vision is used. Compared to the first game, Langermann's status as a cameraman means he carries a more advanced camera, one with clearer footage, zoom, and a sensitive microphone that can be used to detect distant footsteps and other noises. The player is equipped with an inventory system displaying the amount of footage recorded on the camera and the items they are carrying. Spare batteries suitable for the camcorder and med kits to heal are spread throughout the game.   Blake Langermann, an investigative journalist and cameraman working alongside his wife, Lynn, crash-lands in the Supai region of the Coconino County region of Arizona, while following the mysterious murder of a young, pregnant woman known only as Jane Doe. When he wakes up after the crash, Blake finds the pilot of their helicopter skinned and crucified, and his wife missing. Blake makes his way to a nearby town, Temple Gate, where he learns that the town has sacrificed all their children in the name of God. Blake eventually locates Lynn in a chapel, captured by a violent and delirious cult led by ""Papa"" Sullivan Knoth. Knoth claims that Temple Gate lies on the mouth of Hell, and that Lynn is pregnant with the Anti-Christ. They escape the chapel, but Lynn falters, suffering from stomach cramps. The couple are separated when Lynn is kidnapped by the Heretics, an animalistic rival cult who wish to hasten the end of days, and their androgynous leader Val.  Blake is rescued by a man named Ethan who has left Knoth's cult. He tells Blake that Knoth rapes the women of Temple Gate and, once they are pregnant, orders them executed on suspicion of carrying the Anti-Christ. Fearing this fate for his daughter Anna Lee, Ethan convinced her to flee, and she became the Jane Doe that Blake and Lynn were investigating. As Blake rests under Ethan's house, Marta, an imposing woman wielding a large pickaxe and who is one of Knoth's executioners, breaks into Ethan's home and kills him. Blake flees to another chapel, where he learns from a tortured Heretic being interrogated by Knoth that Lynn is imprisoned in the mines under Temple Gate.  Throughout his journey, Blake suffers from progressively more disturbing hallucinations based on his childhood, all while pursued by a grotesque monster. The hallucinations gradually reveal the events surrounding the death of Blake and Lynn's childhood friend, Jessica Gray, at their Catholic elementary school. Blake and Jessica, while staying late at their school, were caught by one of their teachers, Father Loutermilch, who is implied to have been molesting Jessica. Loutermilch sent Blake away, but as Blake was about to leave the school, he heard Jessica's screams and saw her being chased. Blake discovered her to have fallen down a staircase, breaking her neck, with Loutermilch at the top of the stairs. Loutermilch covered up her death as a suicide by hanging, and the monster that has been chasing Blake throughout the school is a perverse, twisted version of how he sees the priest.  Surviving numerous encounters with Marta and the region's other inhabitants, including the syphilis-infected 'Scalled' who were cast out from Temple Gate, Blake finds a document revealing that the Murkoff Corporation is the cause for everyone's insanity due to an experimental mind control station hidden deep in the mountains, with the Heretics being affected far more severely by the waves due to their relative proximity to the station. Arriving at the mines, Blake enters Val's underground temple and finds Lynn, suddenly visibly pregnant. Knoth's cult finally reach them and kill the Heretics, allowing the pair to flee. As dawn breaks, a freak lightning storm begins to destroy the town. Marta reappears and attacks Blake and Lynn, but a cross toppled by lightning from the chapel in the distance impales her. Blake and Lynn hurry to the chapel; Lynn gives birth, but dies soon afterwards. Blake blacks out holding the newborn, implied to be a hallucination by Lynn's last words ""there's nothing there"" and the baby's lack of a shadow.  Knoth greets Blake as he wakes up. He claims that he had to kill all of his followers, and implores Blake to kill the child before slitting his own throat. As Blake walks outside, he sees that Knoth's followers have committed mass suicide via poisoning in preparation for the apocalypse, while Mozart's Ave verum corpus is playing in the background. The sun grows brighter and Blake is engulfed by the light. He has a final vision of chasing Jessica through the school; when he catches her, she promises that she will never let him go, and they start praying.  "

During a round, the players are presented with an order which must be completed within a short time window. The chefs work together to complete that meal in time. Most often, multiple orders of different types or varieties of meals will be presented in a queue, thus requiring the chefs to work together to effectively complete the orders. Completing each order correctly earns coins, with bonuses for speed, while orders that are improperly served do not earn any points but only waste time. The goal is to collect as many coins as possible within the time limit. The players are ranked on a 3-star system based on how many coins they got.  The cooking aspect is made difficult by the layouts of the kitchen, which change each level. Stations for ingredients, preparation areas, stoves and ovens, serving windows, and dishes are generally all separated across the kitchen, requiring time to move between them. There also may be other obstacles or challenges, such as a kitchen separated by a pedestrian crosswalk, with the pedestrians potentially getting in the chef's way. Another kitchen is set on the back of two trucks traveling at different paces down a road, making switching from one half of the kitchen to the other not always possible. Yet another kitchen is set upon an iceberg, requiring players to make more careful movements lest they fall off. There are about 28 different kitchens in the game's campaign along with a final boss level.  Overcooked was designed as a local cooperative experience for up to four players. There is also a competitive multiplayer option, requiring the chefs to score the most points in a limited time. The game also has a single player mode where the player can control two chefs, switching between them at any time, or by selecting a specific control scheme, can attempt to control them both at the same time. There are no present plans for online multiplayer for the game.  "

Players gather, chop, and cook ingredients, combine them on plates, serve dishes, and wash dishes. Between coordinating short orders and bumping into each other's characters, the game tends to overwhelm. The sequel builds atop the original game, which was released in 2016, with new interactive levels, restaurant themes, chef costumes, and recipes. Some levels have moving floors and other obstacles that complicate the cooking process, including portals, moving walkways, and impassable fires. Other levels transition between settings and recipes, such as one that begins with preparing salads in a hot air balloon and ends crashlanded in a sushi kitchen. The sequel introduces ingredient tossing, such that players can throw items to another chef or pot from far away, and online multiplayer, in which teams can connect either across a local wireless network or through online matchmaking.

The game features several different game modes, principally designed around squad-based combat with two opposing teams of six players each. Players select one of over two dozen pre-made hero characters from one of three class types: Damage heroes that deal most of the damage to attack or defend control points, Tank heroes that can absorb a large amount of damage, and Support heroes that provide healing or other buffs for their teammates. Each hero has a unique skill kit, defining their intrinsic attributes like health points and running speed, their primary attacks, several active and passive skills, and an ultimate ability that can only be used after it has been charged through dealing damage to enemies and healing allies. Players can change their hero during the course of a match, as a goal of Overwatch's design was to encourage dynamic team compositions that adapt to the situation. The game's genre has been described by some journalists as a ""hero shooter"", due to its design around specific heroes and classes.  The game features game modes for casual play, competitive ranked play, and for supporting esports competitions including Blizzard's Overwatch League. These modes generally are centered around sequentially securing control of points on the map, or escorting a payload between points on the map, with one team attacking while the other defends. Other modes set aside for casual matches include solo and team deathmatch, capture-the-flag, and unique modes run during various seasonal events. More recent updates have enabled users to craft their own game modes with a limited set of scripting tools. New characters and maps have also been added regularly to the game since launch, expanding the original hero roster from 21 to 32 by April 2020. Regardless of winning or losing a match, players gain experience towards a player level, and on gaining a new level, receive loot boxes that contain cosmetic items that they can use to customize the appearance of the hero characters but otherwise does not affect gameplay. Loot boxes can also be purchased through microtransactions.   The backstory to Overwatch is described through animated shorts and other information distributed by Blizzard in promoting the game.  Overwatch is set sixty years into the future of a fictionalized Earth, thirty years after the resolution of what is known as the ""Omnic Crisis."" Before the Omnic Crisis, humanity had been in a golden age of prosperity and technology development. Humans developed robots with artificial intelligence called ""Omnics"", which were put to use to achieve economic equality, and began to be treated as people in their own right. The Omnic Crisis began when the worldwide automated ""omnium"" facilities that produced them started producing a series of lethal, hostile robots that attacked humankind. Initially, individual countries responded with various programs: the United States developed its Soldier Enhancement Program to produce elite fighters, for example, while Germany assembled the knight-like Crusaders. When individual countries' efforts failed to ward off the Omnics, the United Nations quickly formed Overwatch, an international task force combining these individual programs to combat this threat and restore order.  Two veteran soldiers from the Soldier Enhancement Program were put in charge of Overwatch: Gabriel Reyes and Jack Morrison. Though Overwatch successfully quelled the robotic uprising and brought many talented individuals to the forefront, a rift developed between Reyes and Morrison. Morrison was made the leader of Overwatch while Reyes was given charge of Blackwatch, Overwatch's covert operations division, fighting terrorist organizations like Talon, a group that appears to be trying to start a second Omnic Crisis, and Null Sector, a group of Omnics that revolted against the society that persecuted Omnics following the first Crisis. Overwatch continued to maintain peace across the world for several decades in what came to be called the ""Overwatch Generation"" as the team gained more members, but the rift between Morrison and Reyes intensified. Several allegations of wrongdoing and failures were leveled at Overwatch, leading to a public outcry against the organization and in-fighting between its members, prompting the UN to investigate the situation. During this, an explosion destroyed Overwatch's headquarters in Switzerland, purportedly killing Morrison and Reyes among others. The UN passed the Petras Act, which dismantled Overwatch and forbade any Overwatch-type activity.  Overwatch is set six years after the Petras Act; without Overwatch, corporations have started to take over, fighting and terrorism have broken out in parts of the globe, and there are signs of a second Omnic Crisis occurring in Russia. A former member of Overwatch, the intelligent gorilla Winston, decides to begin reforming Overwatch to protect the peace once again despite the Petras Act, with the team members recruiting old friends and gaining new allies in their fight. Thus it is also revealed that Reyes and Morrison were not killed in the explosion, that, in fact, was the result of a battle between them: Morrison became a masked vigilante known as ""Soldier: 76"", who is trying to uncover the reasons why Overwatch was shut down; while Reyes joined Talon and became ""Reaper"", a terrorist disguised as Death.

After accidentally unleashing a paranormal force on the island, Alex and company must figure out what the force is and how to stop it.  is built around the ""walk and talk"" mechanic: instead of dialogue occurring during cutscenes, speech bubbles appear over Alex's head, giving the player a choice between two or three dialogue options. At the same time, Alex remains free to move around and navigate the game world. Players can select dialogue options at any time during conversations, choosing to wait for other characters to finish, to interrupt, or to remain silent. Certain dialogue options cause a thought bubble with Alex inside it to appear over characters' heads, suggesting that the player's choice had an effect on the characters' relationship.  Objects that can be interacted with in the game world display a small circle next to them. Puzzles in the game are solved by finding the correct frequency on Alex's handheld radio, which can perform actions such as unlocking doors or communicating with ghosts, or by winding up tape recorders at the correct speed. Oxenfree does not have any ""game over"" loss conditions; the player's choices and relationships with the characters determine which of several possible endings the player receives.   Alex (Erin Yvette), a teenager, is on the last ferry heading to the fictional Edwards Island for a weekend party. She is accompanied by Ren (Aaron Kuban), her stoner friend, and Jonas (Gavin Hammon), her new stepbrother. On the island, Alex and company meet Clarissa (Avital Ash), ex-girlfriend of Alex's deceased brother Michael, and Nona (Brittani Johnson), Clarissa's best friend and Ren's love interest. Ren explains the island was once a military base and that the island's only permanent resident, Maggie Adler, has recently died. After camping on the beach, Alex, Ren, and Jonas explore the nearby caves, where it is rumored certain radio frequencies cause supernatural events. In a small cavern, Alex tunes her radio and unexpectedly forms a dimensional rift. A voice answers and the teens experience visions before passing out. Jonas and Alex awake in front of a communications tower elsewhere on the island. Ren calls, having passed out in the woods, while Clarissa calls from the decommissioned military fort on the island.  In the woods, Jonas and Alex encounter supernatural events, including Alex's reflection in the water communicating with her, objects moving on their own, and time looping repeatedly. Time corrects when Alex plays a reel-to-reel tape. They spot Nona, who claims she saw an alternate Jonas and Alex. Alex and Jonas find Ren, but after another time loop, they find him possessed by a ""ghost"". Using the radio, Alex creates another rift which returns Ren to normal. Ren and Nona return to the tower.  At the military fort, Alex's reflection appears in a mirror, giving Alex advice. A ghost questions them and possesses Jonas, revealing that the ghosts are the passengers of the submarine USS Kanaloa, thought lost at sea. Alex creates another rift that revives Jonas. They find Clarissa, but time loops to her jumping to her death before disappearing. Nona, Alex, Jonas, and Ren regroup at Harden Tower. Unable to send a radio transmission off the island, Ren suggests finding the key to Maggie Adler's estate, where she kept a boat. At Adler's estate, a possessed Clarissa talks with Ren; her conversations and scattered letters left behind by Maggie Adler reveal that Adler mistakenly interpreted scrambled messages from Kanaloa as an enemy transmission, and the submarine was sunk by friendly fire. The crew was not killed, but transported to another dimension due to the sub's experimental nuclear reactor. Adler and her friend Anna attempted to communicate with the Kanaloa crew via a radio, but Anna was absorbed through the rift. The Kanaloa crew intend on using Alex and her friends' bodies to escape the dimension, keeping them on the island long enough for their possession attempts to be successful.  Alex and the group discover Maggie Adler's plan to fix the rifts—crossing to the other side of them and tuning the radio within. Alex repeatedly loops back to the past, mainly to times she talked with Michael. A ghost possesses Jonas and attempts to bargain with Alex, offering to spare her and the rest of her friends if they leave Clarissa behind. Returning to the caves, Alex tunes into a rift that sends her into a void. Encountering the possessed Clarissa, the ghosts warn Alex that she will die if the rift is closed, and Clarissa will be kept by the ghosts if Alex leaves through the rift. Alex can choose to leave, erasing Clarissa from existence; close the rift herself, trapping her with the ghosts; or, if she has found enough letters from Maggie Adler, Alex can appeal to the crew members directly, convincing them to let Clarissa and her go. The reflection of Alex giving her advice is revealed to be Alex from the future. She loops back to a conversation with Michael, who admits that he and Clarissa are planning to move away from town and asks for Alex's advice. Time then corrects.  Alex wakes up with the others on the ferry back home; Jonas informs her that whatever she did fixed the rift and that everything is normal. Everyone reveals that, for a limited period, they revisited past memories. They then swear to not tell anyone about their experiences. Nona takes a final group picture.  "

784,Panzer Dragoon,/wiki/Panzer_Dragoon_(video_game),Rail shooter,Sega,Sega,"March 26, 2020","March 26, 2020","March 26, 2020"," Panzer Dragoon spans six levels, each lasting about five minutes, with a variety of boss battles. Over the course of the game, the plot is revealed through cutscenes using the game's own graphic engine. consists of a player controlling a flying dragon and his rider through an aiming reticle that can be moved over the whole screen with the D-pad; the player must shoot a variety of enemies (ranging from machines to monsters) in a 3D post-apocalyptic fantasy environment of barren landscapes and mysterious ruins of a fallen civilization. Progression through the levels is made at a predetermined pace, as the player is constantly set along a rail of gameplay. The only time the game pauses is during boss battles. The field of vision can be directed with the aiming reticle on the x and y-axis, but the overall direction of travel is predetermined. The dragon follows the reticle movements, allowing the player to avoid enemy projectiles and obstacles.  The player has a full, 360-degree field of view, and can quickly look left, right, forward, and behind the dragon. Enemies come from all directions, varying in size and health, and also appear on an on-screen radar that monitors the dragon's surroundings. Two weapons are available: the rider's handgun, which can be fired with a single button press when an enemy enters the aiming reticle, and the homing laser fired by the dragon, which can lock on up to eight enemies by moving the reticle over them while holding down the fire button. Some situations with many enemies on screen require the use of the lock-on laser, while in others, quick gunshots to weak spots will prove more efficient.   In the distant future, thousands of years after a great war between humans and their biologically engineered weapons, humans live in everything from small tribes to large nations. One nation, the Empire, has discovered a black tower in the middle of a lake near their capital, which gave them access to large amounts of ancient weapons which they used to beat back and control the ever present monsters in the world. The Imperials were corrupted by this power and became conquerors of others as opposed to liberators from a violent world.  The introduction movie opens with the protagonist, Keil Fluge (unnamed in the North American version), hunting in a canyon. After seeing an Imperial flying battleship in the sky, he is attacked by two creatures and chases one of them to a large, ancient complex built directly into the rock. He explores the ruin, and sees relics of old technology still hanging from the ceilings. Another gigantic creature suddenly attacks him, and though his weapon is useless against the armored creature, a rumbling triggers a cave in, which crushes the monster and saves Keil. From the newly created hole, an armored, blue dragon flies down the cavern with a rider across its shoulders, being chased by an even bigger black dragon as the cavern is destroyed in an explosion. Regaining consciousness outside, Keil sees the two dragons locked in combat in the air before him. Dodging a blast from the black dragon, the blue dragon's rider is then hit by single shot to the chest, and the black dragon flies away. The blue dragon flies towards Keil. A psychic connection is made between the rider and Keil, who is told not to let the black dragon reach the black tower. The rider then dies and Keil picks up his fallen gun, climbs atop the dragon and flies away, determined to finish the rider's quest.  During the first level of the game, Keil and his dragon fly through a drowned city, where they encounter a small Imperial patrol ship.  That ship sends a report to a large fleet of ships flying above the clouds. It is revealed that the Imperial forces are specifically searching for the blue dragon. The second level is a desert, where Keil and the dragon encounter gigantic worm-like creatures. At the stormy edge of the desert, they are confronted by the Black Dragon, which is defeated and speeds away. The third level is a mountainous landscape at night-time where Keil and the dragon get reacquainted with the Imperial forces, which were exploring ancient ruins. These encounters illustrate the ongoing conflict between the Imperial forces and the ancient machines and creatures. The fourth level is an ancient facility in which Keil and the dragon are pursued by both Imperial airships and cybernetic sentinels left behind by the ancient civilization. During the fifth level, they defeat a large armada of the most powerful Imperial ships over a forested area. A cutscene then shows a fleet of dragon-like creatures coming out of the tower to attack the Imperial forces. The sixth level features the black dragon and Keil racing through the battle-scarred Imperial capital. During this, they are both waylaid by the creatures and machines seen attacking the Imperial fleet around the tower while also being fired on by Imperial defenses. The black dragon then reaches the Tower and is mutated into a gigantic super-dragon and begins a climactic battle with Keil and the blue dragon, after which the black dragon is defeated and falls into the ocean.  In the ending cutscene, Keil and the dragon enter the tower. While traveling down a long corridor, the dragon surrounds Keil in a force field, lifting him from the saddle and suspending him in the hallway. Keil watches as the dragon continues on to the core of the tower, then a blinding light is seen and the tower explodes. Keil wakes up some time later in a desert area abutting the ocean. Looking down, he sees the foot prints of the blue dragon around him, indicating that after the explosion, the dragon carried him to safety and flew away.  "
785,Panzer Paladin,/wiki/Panzer_Paladin,Action,Tribute Games,Tribute Games,Unreleased,"July 21, 2020","July 21, 2020"," In this 8-bit style game, the player is in control either as the strong power armor called the Paladin or as the small but swift Squire pilot. As the Paladin, the player can pick up melee weapons dropped by defeated enemies. The swordplay mechanic includes high versus low attacking and blocking and a rock-paper-scissor weapon type system that grants attack bonuses. It is also possible to cast different types of spells by breaking weapons.  The player may also eject from the power armor and play as the small Squire pilot.

787,The Park,/wiki/The_Park_(video_game),Action-adventure,Funcom,Funcom,Unreleased,"October 22, 2019","October 22, 2019"," The Park is experienced from a first-person perspective as the player, Lorraine, interacts with and experiences the decrepit environment of Atlantic Island Park. There is no combat or defense and the player has no health HUD as Lorraine can only interact with limited objects in-game and there are no enemies to battle. These objects mostly consist of pages that reveal the backstory of the park and later, Lorraine. Lorraine can call out to character Callum at any time during gameplay, and this may have a small affect as it allows Lorraine to follow Callum's voice and thus continue the narrative of the story or to reach necessary areas or objectives within the park such as the rides. The rides act as both exposition and scares. To enter the House of Horrors, Lorraine must find a flashlight. Throughout the game, Lorraine narrates her feelings and memories to the player.   The game follows Lorraine, a struggling single mother and widow with a troubled past, as she searches for her young son, Callum, who goes missing in Atlantic Island Park. Lorraine enters the park after her son just as the park prepares to close for the afternoon, only to find that nighttime comes unnaturally fast as she ascends the escalator and discovers the park to be abandoned, vandalized and rundown as if several years have passed. Despite abandonment, the rides and lights mysteriously still function. Lorraine calls for Callum and his voice calls to her, leading her through the decrepit park.  Lorraine boards several rides which reveal the themes and backstory of the game: the Tunnel of Tales tells the story of Hansel and Gretel, this time with a new ending - in which after cooking the witch in the oven, Hansel and Gretel devour her. On the Ferris Wheel, Lorraine remembers Callum's father Don, a construction worker at the park who died in a fall from the Ferris Wheel when Lorraine was still pregnant with Callum. Between rides, Lorraine expresses her frustration with Callum, her belief that she is a failure as a mother, her history of mental health problems, and her fear that Callum is becoming changed by some mysterious threat. However, while aboard the roller coaster, a monstrous top-hatted ringmaster (identified in the credits as The Boogeyman) accosts Lorraine and claims 'the Witch' has her son.  According to notes found throughout the area, the park's grounds are hinted to have a sinister history that tainted them, as a consequence of previous owner Archibald Henderson's actions, which the new owner Mr. Winter tried to take advantage of: several notes indicate that he had found a way to unlock the power hidden beneath the grounds by harvesting the positive emotions of guests, and believed that the energy he unlocked would be enough to grant him immortality. However, workers and employees alike experienced feelings of anxiety as a result of the process, and a number of fatal incidents occurred. One noticeable case involved 'Chad the Chipmunk', the park's mascot: Steve, the employee wearing the chipmunk suit, became disturbed and reluctant to remove the suit as time went on - and ultimately murdered a teenager with an icepick. Following Steve's arrest and the disappearance of over a dozen children inside the House of Horrors, the Park was forced to close permanently, drawing Lorraine's perceptions during the introduction into question.  At last, Lorraine enters the witch-faced House of Horrors, still following Callum, and remarking on the similarity between this and the Hansel and Gretel story. Inside, messages from Mr. Winter reveal that he retreated into the House with his machines when the Park closed, hoping to achieve immortality by other means. However, the interior of the House changes to a loop of Lorraine and Callum's own home through time, where it is revealed that Lorraine's father abused and abducted her as a child, her estranged mother refuses to help her in the belief that she ran away from home, and she suffered from depression when Callum was born and given electroshock therapy. As Lorraine passes through each version of her house, it becomes more decrepit and disturbing. At the end, she finds a message by Mr. Winter revealing that he needs children for his harvesting machines, and has already kidnapped and killed at least one in order to fuel his immortality; notes such as these, combined with popular depictions of Winter in a similar ringmaster's garb and top hat, suggest that he is actually the Boogeyman haunting the grounds.  Lorraine reveals that in the oldest versions of the Hansel and Gretel story, the cruel mother and the Witch were the same person, and that she believes she is the real Witch - apparently accepting that her neglect of Callum was the indirect cause of Callum's disappearance. Finally, she reaches Callum, lying unconscious on a slab. Chad the Chipmunk appears behind her, then is replaced by the Boogeyman, who forces a bloody icepick into Lorraine's hands, then guides her hands so she holds the point above Callum's chest; however, he then releases her hands and vanishes, allowing Lorraine to stab Callum in the heart.  Afterwards, Lorraine is sitting in a police station interrogation room, clearly grief-stricken. A detective identical to the Park gatekeeper enters, carrying a jar with a bee in it, and tells her not to worry about losing things and to think of the last place she saw her son. Lorraine narrates that, in her heart and mind, she will always return to Atlantic Island Park. Ultimately, though the supernatural elements of the game are eventually confirmed to be true by the game's ties with The Secret World and Lorraine's appearance in later issues of the game, it's left ambiguous as to how much of The Park was real and how much was simply imaginary.

789,Party Hard,/wiki/Party_Hard_(video_game),Action,Pinokl Games,TinyBuild,Unreleased,"November 22, 2018","November 22, 2018"," If a player kills a person within other party-goer's sight, they are alerted and will call the cops, and if the NPC finds a dead body, they will call the cops, who put bodies in body bags. In addition to that, players can hide dead bodies in dumpsters and other concealed locations. Players can set traps, such as poisoning drinks, making speakers explode, destroying dance floors, cutting down trees, starting fires and short-circuiting electricity boards. Players also have limited use weapons like swords (with an area damage), bombs and stun grenades, which are collected from containers. One can also pick up disguises and other collectibles. Bouncers are present regularly, and if one spots a player, the bouncers will start to chase the player, resulting in death if caught. If a player keeps using a certain shortcut to escape the police and is able to escape, a person will block that shortcut so that no players can use it. Partying people are distracted most of the time, and a single player can take more than 2 to 3 people out in this manner before being detected. The police are ruthless, being very hard to escape from, unless the player knows the level very well. Special agents are called in if too many policemen are killed. If a player dies or gets arrested, the level can be continued by the remaining players, and all players will be revived when starting the next level. However, if all players are killed, this results in a failure.   Initially, you play as an unnamed man who is described as ""a guy who just wanted some peace and quiet"" who finds it difficult to sleep when there are active party-goers nearby. He decides to kill them all using a standard knife. There are five other unlockable characters, including a Ninja (obtained by clearing a level with no bodies found), Policeman (obtained by completing all the levels), Katie (obtained by escaping the police 5 times in one game; also the only person available on the Miami Beach level), the Butcher (obtained by killing 20 people), and Hinter (starts the game with). Each level takes place at a party with a different theme, interactive objects, and ""special guests,"" who are people that you call to distract/kill party guests. The completion of these levels also unlocks the storyline, which focuses on Detective John West's detailing of the Party Hard Killings of autumn, 2000.  The story starts in the present with the inspector John West being interviewed, in the interrogation room, by a cop named Darius who asks him about the Party Hard killings of autumn 2000. His narration, as well as the game, starts in the year 2000, somewhere in San Francisco County with the killer, fed up of the noise and of a small neighbourhood party. He then takes a knife and a hockey mask to start a massacre into a BBQ house party somewhere in North Beach (Salinas, California according to menu map). After he was ""done"" with the party goers, he gets picked up by bikers who take him to ranch party in Bakersfield and after that leaves to Las Vegas via a shuttle bus to a casino party and rooftop party near Arizona.  Several months later, he reaches Bay City, Texas and boards a cruise liner heading from Trinity Bay to Florida, only for it burn down and sink near Miami, Florida as the killer watches, he also meets up with Katie (Detective John West's daughter) there. She follows his footsteps by attacking a beach party, either being forced into it by her by the killer, or as a way to join him on his killings, and according to Darius, was abused by John. The killer takes a party bus on Route 10 with Katie only to murder everyone on board. John West finds them when the party bus got stuck on the road after they killed the driver, but it was too late since the killer had already slaughtered his daughter, the killer was almost about to put himself in jail, until on the way through the forest he, somehow, left John West unconscious and cut down a tree, causing it to fall on the police car.  They end up crashing near Salina, Kansas at saw mill. After murdering everyone there, the killer fakes being a victim and escapes the scene by an ambulance. He murders his way through a rooftop pool party at Denver, Colorado and a Halloween party in Wyoming. After a campus party in Salt Lake City, Utah was hit, and finally ends up was a party in the San Francisco subway hosted by some of his fanatics where the detective sought to stop the serial killer.  In the whole final cutscene, the party hard killer is shown seated on the train platform after killing everybody in the underground, with John and Darius's voices speaking to each other in the interrogation room, showing that the interrogation was all going on inside John's head. John finally confronting him about the murders. Darius stating he never fought back against him, and that some part of him enjoyed killing party goers just as much he did. John arguing off and trying to state ""he isn't like him."" Darius starts to work him over, telling him to ""let it go."" The game ending with John saying ""come on Darius, let's go home,"" and a clip of them in the underground, Darius putting John's  policeman hat and his mask back on.  "
791,Payday 2,/wiki/Payday_2,First-person shooter,Overkill Software,Starbreeze Studios,Unreleased,"February 27, 2018","February 23, 2018"," The game consists of a variety of 'heists' that a player can opt to either carry out by themselves, with the AI, or as part of a multiplayer game. There are heists such as bank robberies, drug trafficking runs, rigging an election, or stealing smuggled nuclear warheads. Some of the heists put a large emphasis on stealth, often leading to bonus experience points and money on completion, and certain heists can only be done in stealth.  The level selection menu is styled as a fictional website, Crime.net, where missions pop up periodically as contracts in a map of Washington, D.C. The player can pick up an open contract, join a contract another player has started, or buy a contract with in-game money in an offshore bank account. There are seven difficulty levels: Normal, Hard, Very Hard, Overkill, Mayhem, Death Wish, and Death Sentence (formerly One Down), with increased money and experience payouts for higher difficulty levels. Currently there is an option to enable the ""One Down"" function on any difficulty, meaning that players can only go down once before going into custody (goes up to two downs with the ""Nine Lives"" skill aced). Independent of difficulty was the ""pro job"" condition - pro jobs give additional experience, but cannot be retried if the players fail. Pro Jobs were later removed in an update. Some contracts in Payday 2 take place over multiple days, with each day represented by a separate level with different objectives. After certain days of heists are completed in 'loud' (In which the alarm has sounded) the game may add an escape level, where the players' original escape is thwarted and they must survive to reach their backup getaway.  Many jobs in Payday 2 can be completed in stealth. If players avoid getting caught on camera, evade or silently kill security guards, don't kill more than four guards with pagers (number of pagers may be lowered via modifications in the ""crime spree"" gamemode) and keep any civilian witnesses from calling the police, the alarm will not be raised and the players will receive an experience bonus. Otherwise, players will have to achieve their objectives, carry out any loot they find to a dropoff point, and then reach their escape point under the pressure of constant police assault waves. Most of the enemies are SWAT units sourced from D.C. police, then FBI SWAT, GenSec private security contractors and finally the DHS as difficulty increases. Mixed in with these are special units; all versions of Payday 2 include the ""Shield"" and the ""Taser"" - both named for their signature equipment, the ""Bulldozer"" - a SWAT team member in a modified near-bulletproof bomb suit, and snipers. The Crimewave Edition and PC version include the ""Cloaker"" - an infiltration and hand-to-hand combat expert. Exclusive to the PC and Crimewave editions are near-indestructible SWAT van turrets, capable of area denial, a medic capable of returning an enforcer to full health with no status effects, and Captain Winters, a well-protected veteran police officer who sustains assaults and buffs enemies until he can be driven off.  If a player takes too much damage they will be knocked down and incapacitated. If no one helps them back up, or if they are downed a number of times without healing up via a ""doctor bag"", they will be taken into custody. On lower difficulty levels players in custody will eventually come out of custody after a set time period, but otherwise, their teammates must take a hostage to trade to get them back into the game. A job is failed if all players are downed or in custody (but some jobs have unique failure conditions, such as the loud only heist, Cook Off by adding the incorrect ingredient and blowing up the meth lab).  At the end of each heist, the player is presented with a screen with three cards, one of which is to be chosen by the player (called a ""Payday""). These bonus cards can be either weapon modifications, masks, safes, colors or materials for masks, bonus experience or money. Players can purchase and customize masks, although these are purely cosmetic and have no effect on the gameplay.  Throughout the game, players accumulate money and experience. The money is divided into two parts. 20% of the money is given to the player to spend on weapons, masks and skills, and 80% is placed into the player's ""Offshore Account"", which is intended as part of the story to be the player's retirement fund, however the player can use it to purchase heists from a broker, to buy bonus cards without performing a heist, to become infamous, or a player can press a button in their safehouse to 'burn' all of it.  During the 4th day of ""The Search For Kento"" event the Crime Spree gamemode was added, in which players complete heists simultaneously to earn large rewards. As the player completes heists, their crime spree rank adds up, with the amount of ranks varying depending on the heist chosen. Every 20 ranks, players must choose modifiers for loud, and every 26 ranks players must choose modifiers for stealth, making the heists increasingly more difficult, and every 50 ranks the enemy's health and damage is increased. Starting a new crime spree with no points costs 0 continental coins, but starting a crime spree at a certain point amount can vary in continental coin cost, from 20 ranks for 10 continental coins, to 40 ranks for 20 coins, to the player's personal highest crimespree for a certain amount. When choosing a heist, players have to choose from one of three heists given to them, but can choose to reroll the heists for 6 continental coins. Players do not automatically get their rewards, instead they can choose to end their crime spree, giving them all the rewards, including loot, payday bonus cards, and continental coins. If a player fails a heist, or their game closes during the heist for whatever reason, their crime spree can no longer be continued, and they can choose to either pay a certain amount of continental coins to resume the crime spree, or end it and take the rewards. At 0 ranks, every heist will start at ""Overkill"" difficulty, but the modifiers can manage to higher the difficulty to even above ""Death Sentence"". During the pre-planning part of the heists, certain ""Gage Perks"" can be purchased with continental coins to provide players with buffs.  As players earn experience points, their reputation level increases. When a player's level increases they earn skill points, allowing them to buy abilities and bonuses from skill trees representing five criminal archetypes and playstyles. They have two stages: Basic and Aced It is not possible to max out every single tree and players are often encouraged to mix and match skills from each tree to maximize usefulness. Players also receive ""perk points,"" in proportion to their experience earned, that can be used to unlock additional bonuses from 17 ""perk decks."" Players can switch between 15 profiles of skills, perk decks, weapons and equipment at no cost before starting a heist.  When a player reaches level 100, they can opt to raise their ""Infamy"" level, up to twenty-five (as of 5 January 2020; there are only five levels of Infamy on PS3 and Xbox 360). Becoming Infamous grants a player access to special skill trees and items and gives them special poses in lobby screens. However, raising one's Infamy level causes them to lose all of their spending money and experience, and a sum of $200,000,000 is deducted from their offshore account until they reach Infamy level 5 (going 'Infamous' after this point is free)   While the game has no set linear campaign, each heist takes place around the same time that it was released in the real world. In addition, some other plot details are presented through web comics, trailers, and the 'FBI Files' website.  Payday 2, when first released, allowed players to control one of four pseudonymous robbers, three of these returned from Payday: The Heist: former Chicago mobster Dallas (portrayed by Eric Etebari, voiced by Simon Kerr), ex-Swedish software developer Wolf (Ulf Andersson), and rogue Navy SEAL and mercenary Chains (Damion Poitier). The fourth member of the gang, the English crook Hoxton (portrayed by Josh Lenn, voiced by Pete Gold), was arrested by the FBI in between the events of the two games, so Dallas' younger brother Houston (voiced by Derek Ray) is recruited to take his place.  The gang's command and control, the secretive Bain (portrayed by Digger T. Mesch, voiced by Simon Viklund), sets up Crime.net, an online service for contractors to hire criminals for jobs that they need doing. Two years after the events of the first game, Dallas returns to heisting and Bain contracts him with the task of sneaking into a police department to steal a flash drive and use it to delete the intel the police have on Crime.net. Afterwards, Dallas raids a mobster's nightclub to retrieve cocaine that belonged to Bain's acquaintance and fights through the police force to escape by helicopter. Bain then arranges for the Payday Gang to relocate to Washington D.C. and helps them set up heists and jobs in the area, and connecting the gang with other contractors. The first is Vlad (Ilia Volok), a Ukrainian gangster trying to reassert his power after getting out of prison. They assist him by intimidating mall and store owners into paying him protection money, in addition to harassing his rival, Dmitri, by robbing his nightclub and stealing a tiara made for his wife. The next is Hector Morales (Gary Daniels), a Colombian drug trafficker trying to oust the rival Mendoza cartel. They start by protecting a shipment of cocaine as it is ambushed by police, then weaken the Mendozas by destroying their weapons shipments and burning their stored money at a local bank. When the surviving Mendozas try to give evidence to the FBI in exchange for passage out of the country, Hector has the gang assassinate them. Finally, there is The Elephant, (Bokeem Woodbine) a corrupt Republican politician who hires the gang to aid his party, framing a local senator by planting cocaine in his apartment, or by exposing an arms deal made by that senator.  Later in 2013, the gang rob a diamond store as well as number of armored truck convoys (and a train) run by the GenSec security company. Their next job comes in early 2014, when the Elephant tasks them with tampering with the upcoming election to ensure that his ally, Bob McKendrick, becomes mayor of Washington D.C. In order to achieve this, the gang tracks a truck carrying voting machines to a warehouse at night. They infiltrate the warehouse, find the voting machines, and hack them in order for their votes to swing in the Republicans' favor. Thanks to their trickery, McKendrick is elected as mayor of Washington. They also assist weapons smuggler Gage (Dash Mihok) by performing a midnight raid on a warehouse belonging to the Murkywater PMC.  Later in the year, Dallas is introduced to ""The Dentist"" (Giancarlo Esposito) - a middleman for a number of wealthy clients, who seems to know a lot about the gang. Dallas initially refuses his offer of work, but when The Dentist reveals that he can use his connections to help free Hoxton from prison, he changes his mind. In order to test their skill, The Dentist makes the gang rob the Benevolent Bank, which had never been successfully robbed in its two-hundred-year history. Satisfied, he has them assassinate a Russian mob boss known as 'The Commissar', who has ties to Washington's district attorney. With the Commissar dead, the Dentist uses his connections to force the DA into giving Hoxton a retrial at a local courthouse, giving the gang a perfect opportunity to ambush his guards and free him. While glad for the rescue, Hoxton is annoyed that his alias and mask were usurped by Dallas' brother and insists that they rename him Houston, but he is allowed to keep Hoxton's old mask. After escaping the police, Hoxton and the gang raid the FBI headquarters to obtain intel on an informant who helped to imprison him.  Around the same time, Chains is on vacation in Sweden when he is ambushed by Interpol agents. He is able to escape thanks to a tip off from John Wick (Dave Fouquette), an old friend from his time in the Navy SEALs. Having recently come out of retirement to enact revenge on New York's Russian mob, Wick tells Chains that he is looking for a crew, to which he responds by inviting him to the gang. After rescuing Vlad's brother-in-law from a plane crash in the woods, the gang descend upon the McKendrick museum in order to steal 'the diamond', a valuable gemstone that the Dentist is interested in. Hoxton's former partner-in-crime, the Irish burglar Clover (Aoife Duffin), is recruited to help, becoming the first female member of the gang.  In January 2015, Bain is contacted by a Croatian weapons smuggler known as the Butcher (Mira Furlan), who sends Dragan (Dragomir Mrsic), a crooked Interpol agent, to help the gang steal a thermobaric bomb. The gang steal the weapon in one of two ways - either by stealing it from a ship at the docks, or intercepting a train carrying it in the middle of a forest. After the job is complete, Dragan stays in the U.S. as a permanent member of the gang. After this, Hoxton is contacted by an old associate named Bonnie (Rhona Cameron), who possesses information vital to finding the rat that sold him out, and she bargains this information in exchange for a place in the gang. Knowing where the informant is hiding, the gang infiltrate his FBI safehouse to find that it was Hector who ratted on Hoxton. They kill him and recover the evidence that the FBI have about them. Around this time, Jacket (protagonist of Hotline Miami) joins the gang through unknown means, just as the gang further humiliate GenSec by stealing money from various display vaults at their newly built arena, during a concert by Swedish DJ Alesso.  Later in the year, the Dentist gives the gang his final job - a heist on the Golden Grin Casino in Las Vegas. The vault beneath it is tougher than any they have faced before, so Bain recruits Russian hockey star Sokol (Alexej Manvelov), who moonlights as a casino thief and possesses expert technical knowledge, to help them. With his help, they build the 'BFD' (Big Fucking Drill) and use it to break into the casino's vault. The Dentist's target is a strange box hidden deep within, though the gang make off with the money inside the vault as well. Soon after this, Bain recruits former Yakuza member Jiro (Togo Igawa), who travels to the U.S. in search of his long lost son, Kento.  In September, Mayor McKendrick, becoming increasingly unpopular due to Washington's rising crime rate, betrays the gang by hiring Commissioner Solomon Garrett in an effort to end their crime spree. Garrett uses Captain Neville Winters in the field in order to assist and inspire regular police in their fight against the gang, but his presence has little effect. After protecting one of Vlad's weapon shipments in an earthquake-hit Los Angeles, the gang are forced to work for Murkywater officer Vernon Locke (Ian Russell) after he hacks into Crime.net. Locke puts them in contact with Bodhi (Josh Lenn), who helps them raid a Murkywater black site in Nevada, and steal pallets of cash from a Murkywater cargo plane.  The gang's first job of 2016 comes from Vlad, who is eager to capitalise on a power vacuum in Washington's drug trade that was created as a result of Hector's death. He has them intercept a shipment of goats with bags of cocaine smuggled in their rectums. Though an accident scatters the goats around a city block, the gang retrieve them and take them to an associate to have the packages removed. Unfortunately, they are ambushed by a Honduran cartel before this can be done, forcing them to extract the goats by plane as they fight off both cartel members and police. Once this is done, Dallas meets with the Elephant again, who offers them a job from the mysterious Akan. Before Dallas can agree, he and the gang meet a strange man named Jimmy (Sharlto Copley), who convinces them that Akan is evil and offers them an alternative job. With Jimmy's help, they steal an EMP bomb from a Murkywater train yard and use it to break into a hidden laboratory run by Akan in Russia. While fighting off mercenaries, they steal data relating to Akan's super soldier project and destroy it.  The next addition to the gang, Australian Kelli 'Sydney' King (Georgia van Cuylenburg), introduces herself sometime later, showing up unannounced during a bank heist and using the surprise of her sudden entrance to steal a bag of money. Impressed by her audacity, Bain offers her a spot in the gang. Not long after, the Elephant requests the gang's help again, putting them in contact with Tom 'Rust' Bishop (Ron Perlman), a former member of the Overkill motorcycle club, who has information regarding a BCI helmet that is in the hands of the club. Rust refuses to part with this knowledge, however, until the gang rescue his friend Mike, a mechanic, and help him fix up his personal bike. After obeying his requests and getting the info they need, the gang steal the helmet from a freight train in transit, fighting through waves of bikers and police before escaping by helicopter.  The gang go quiet until October. Hoxton, frustrated with the gang's small safehouse beneath a local laundromat, destroys it, organising for them all to move into a larger one elsewhere in the city, contacting his old family butler Aldstone (John Cleese), who agrees to fly to Washington to tend to their new home. The Continental Hotel, an establishment in Manhattan that caters exclusively to criminals, offers to have some associates help improve the new safehouse in exchange for their 'Continental Coin' currency. As Christmas approaches, the gang help Vlad's brother-in-law again when he is cornered by police at a local mall, before they are given another job by the Butcher. One of her ships in the Caribbean was sunk by the local Sosa cartel, so she has them travel to Miami and assassinate the cartel's boss, Ernesto, who resides in the old mansion of Cuban drug lord Tony Montana. At this time, Montana (André Sogliuzzo) joins the gang.  In early 2017, the Continental requests the gang's help. An employee, Charon (Lance Reddick), has been ambushed by mobsters in Brooklyn. After saving his life, Charon repays the gang by tipping them off about an amount of illegal money kept hidden on a yacht owned by Mayor McKendrick in New York harbor. In retaliation for his betrayal, the gang infiltrate the yacht while it is used as a venue for a re-election fundraiser, stealing the money along with a hard drive containing the passwords to McKendrick's offshore bank accounts.  In April, Locke contacts the gang, informing them of the existence of a mysterious organization which seeks to destroy them. Locke tells them that an informant of this organization can be located downtown, and the gang set off to meet them. Upon arrival, the informant is revealed to be Matt Roscoe, a former driver who betrayed the gang two years ago. Roscoe escapes in a van, while the gang pursue him on foot, mirroring the scenario of Roscoe's previous betrayal. The van crashes into a nearby construction site, where the gang set the van on fire to force Roscoe out, which succeeds after a prolonged firefight. As Roscoe is forced out of the van, he offers information about Kento, Jiro's son, in exchange for his life. Jiro interrogates Roscoe for the information, and it is revealed that a member of the Yakuza, known only as 'Kazuo', may know something about Kento's whereabouts. Using his contacts, Bain engineers a prison riot to necessitate a prison transfer. During the transfer, the gang ambush the convoy on Green Bridge, free Kazuo, and escape. Shortly afterwards, Mexican Cartel member Sangres (Joseph Balderrama) joins the gang, introduced to the Payday gang by Gage.  In October, Duke (Nicholas Colicos) joins through unknown means. Locke contacts the gang to help with a weapons deal. He is smuggling weapons to the Butcher, and needs some extra muscle to back him up. When the train arrives in Alaska, he double-crosses both the Payday gang and the Butcher. Heavily armed police forces arrive on the scene, and apprehend the Butcher's mercenaries and attempt to take the Payday gang into custody. The Payday gang manage to fight their way out and free the Butcher's mercenaries, allowing both groups to escape on a ship. Seeking revenge, the Payday gang steal diamonds from the Garnet Group, who are linked to Locke, and put a dent into Locke's financial resources by crippling the Garnet Group.  In December, Bain teams up with the Cabots and insiders Ethan and Hila to rob the Garnet Group boutique located in LA. After entering the store, they immediately find out that it was a police ambush when Mr. Brown is killed by a sniper. During the heist, Bain remarks about how he is encountering ""odd interference"" while hacking through the systems. After fighting their way out of the ambush and successfully securing the diamonds with Mr. Blonde, the gang creates a distraction to allow him to escape. However, when the Payday gang reaches their escape van, Bain is attacked and his transmissions encounter heavy interference before he tells the gang to ""trust Locke"". The next day, Locke reveals that his ""betrayal"" was coordinated with Bain as a ruse to quickly get the gang out of DC and into Alaska because somebody had been searching for the gang in DC. He takes over for Bain temporarily and helps them escape. He then introduces Joy (Siu-See Hung) to the gang to deal with Crime.net while not heisting. Working off of clues Bain has left behind, he helps the Payday crew rob a bank in Brooklyn and steal a medallion containing important information buried under the foundation of the bank.  Sometime later, the Elephant is arrested through the use of falsified evidence, catching the attention of the gang. Locke orders the group to retrieve an item that the Elephant possessed before his incarceration. The gang perform a silent break-in on the FBI headquarters, the same building the gang raided immediately after Hoxton was freed. The gang discover the item, a box with an uncanny resemblance to the one found in the Golden Grin Casino, and secure it. Duke's study of the box reveals that the Dentist's box, along with a third box, is located at Henry's Rock, a Murkywater warehouse and research outpost located in the desert. The gang infiltrates the warehouse via shipping crates, and recovers the two boxes. However, as the gang leave, Jiro's son Kento, now a Murkywater officer, appears behind bulletproof glass, along with a broadcast of a bound, gagged and bloodied figure, suspected to be Bain, with the Dentist standing behind him. The revelation that his long-lost son is working for the very mercenary group he opposes horrifies Jiro. Back at the safehouse, Duke manages to open the boxes with the medallion, revealing the contents to be several ornately crafted rings, and an orb with a similar pattern, although the third box is empty.  The Elephant is freed from his incarceration, and provides a tip for the gang. The fictional Shacklethorne expedition to Antarctica, thought lost, was recently discovered quite a distance away from its intended destination, along with a sled containing numerous artifacts buried beside a mutilated corpse. The recovered artifacts are being auctioned off at an exclusive party in Salem, along with an item that is supposedly connected to the contents of the three boxes. The gang enters the auction and retrieves the item, which is revealed to be a black hexagonal tablet, the missing item from the third box.  Finally getting a lead on Bain's location, Locke assists the gang in infiltrating a Murkywater prison facility in order to break him out. Before they can successfully sneak in however, the Dentist reveals over the prison's intercoms that the entirety of the prison was already aware of their presence, also effectively revealing to the gang that he himself was in fact the one who orchestrated Bain's kidnapping and provided information to Murkywater. The gang then fight through the ambush and manage to successfully free Bain from his cell. Following the trail of death and destruction left behind as he made his way to the rooftop, they find Bain, bloodied and bandaged, having strangled Kento to death with his bare hands. Bain then suddenly collapses, before Locke appears and helps carry him to an escape helicopter. After Locke has some hired professionals inspect Bain, he informs the gang that Bain has been infected with a man-made virus, which was ironically stolen by the Payday gang from Mercy Hospital in the first game. Meanwhile, another team of the gang is tasked with launching an attack on a Murkywater compound in Mexico in order to diminish and cut off their supplies. Soon later, the same team robs a bank on Mexico as a favor to Vlad.  Having retrieved Bain, the gang now plan to carry out ""the heist to end all heists""; infiltrate the White House and steal presidential pardons. Thanks to Locke, the gang manage to get into the White House and successfully escape with all of the pardons in hand. A dying Bain congratulates them on managing to pull off such a monumental heist, before he finally succumbs to the virus and dies.   Somewhere in Mexico, Locke and the gang hold a solemn ceremony for their fallen mentor. Standing around an open grave, they all take off their masks and throw them in, save for Dallas, and begin to quietly disperse. Locke gives a final salute to Bain, silently nodding at Dallas as he walks away. After a few moments, Dallas finally takes off his mask and takes a long look at it, before he too turns away to leave.  "

793,Penguin Wars,/wiki/Penguin_Wars,Action,City Connection,JP,"September 21, 2017","June 27, 2019","June 27, 2019"," The player participates in a sport called ""Dojiball"" (ドジボール, dojibōru), a pun on the Japanese prononciation of ""Dodgeball"". In the arcade and Nintendo Entertainment System editions of the game, the five animals featured are the penguin, bear, panda, koala and beaver, with the penguin being controlled by the player. In the Game Boy version, the player can choose as any one of the five animals, which, in addition to the penguin, are a cow, rabbit, bat, and rat. In all versions of the game, the player plays against all the other animals. In each game, the participating animals find each other on opposite sides of a square table with five balls on each side. The object of the game is to roll those balls over the table. As soon as all ten balls are on one player's side, that player loses the game. Each game also has a time limit of 60 seconds; if that is reached, the player with the fewest balls on their side wins.  If a player is hit by one of the balls, they are knocked unconscious for a certain amount of time. Thus, it could also be said that part of the object of the game is to hit the opponent, as otherwise it would not be possible to get all ten balls to the other side (the opponent can just roll them back before all of them have arrived).  The different animals have different strengths and weaknesses which are a trade-off with each other. For example, the rat is the one that can move left and right the fastest, but in return he can roll the balls only very slowly. The cow, on the other hand, is a very slow walker, but in return she regains consciousness more quickly.  After thirty seconds of playing, a jellybean-like obstacle appears in the middle of the table which moves left and right. Different kinds of these obstacles cause varying effects on the trajectory of the balls; some deflect them so they start rolling diagonally (the players themselves can only roll them parallel to the sides of the table), whereas others simply have the ball bounce straight back.

795,Persona 5 Scramble,/wiki/Persona_5_Scramble,Action role-playing,Omega Force,Atlus,"February 20, 2020",Unreleased,Unreleased," Persona 5 Scramble is a gameplay crossover between Koei Tecmo's hack and slash Dynasty Warriors series, and Atlus's role-playing game Persona series. It features elements from both franchises, such as the real-time action combat of the former with the turn-based Persona-battling aspect of the latter.  Joker, the game's protagonist, is able to wield multiple Personas, which are gained through random drops or by defeating named mini-bosses in dungeons. These Personas can then be brought to the Velvet Room, where they can be fused to create new Personas. The Confidant system from Persona 5 is absent. In its place are Requests, a form of side-quests, and the B.A.N.D. system, where increasing its level can grant players bonuses such as stat increases. The B.A.N.D. levels can be increased through interacting with party members, winning battles, and hitting milestones throughout the game.  Players can form an active party of maximum four members, with Joker being the only character not removable as an active party member. Outside of battle, active party members can be swapped with the standby party members. Players can only control Joker in the real world but is able to control any party member freely when exploring the story dungeons. Exploring dungeons is similar to Persona 5, where players can use stealth to avoid enemies or may occasionally face the need to solve puzzles to progress. The 'Third Eye' also makes a return from Persona 5, where it highlights enemies strength and interactive objects. Should the alert meter of the dungeon reach 100%, the party is forced to leave the dungeon. The Alert level can be lowered by winning battles that are initiated with surprise attacks or by leaving the dungeon. Unlike previous entries of the Persona series, leaving the dungeon does not progress time and there are generally no demerits in leaving the story dungeons.   Battles are mostly initiated when the player character comes into contact with the enemy, where they can launch a surprise attack to gain a combat advantage if the enemy has not spotted them. Battles are also now in the form of a real-time combat system. However, players will use a command-based skills menu when using Persona skills. During the time in this menu, the battle will pause to allow tactical positioning of the Persona skills. If the party deals a critical damage or deals damage that the enemy is weak to, the enemy may be knocked down for an 'All-Out Attack' which deals a large amount of damage. All party members can obtain new moves, known as Master Arts, by controlling the characters manually and defeating enemies. If all active party members are knocked out in battle, the game ends.   The game is set four months after the events of Persona 5, The protagonist and Morgana return to Tokyo for a reunion with the other Phantom Thieves of Hearts to spend their summer vacation together on a camping trip. To determine the camping preparations, they use a popular application called EMMA. While going to Shibuya to buy the necessary tools, they pass by a rising idol, Alice Hiiragi, who gave the protagonist a card requesting them to input ""Wonderland"" into the EMMA app for her special event. Upon entering the keyword, however, he, Morgana and Ryuji are transported into a mysterious alternative version of Tokyo called a Jail, where they encounter the ruler called King who is Alice's Shadow self, and a sentient A.I. named Sophia who is able to fight Shadows who joins their party. They learn that EMMA, similar to the Metaverse Navigator, enables them to enter Jails. Hearing rumors that people have been attacked by Shadows in Jails that leaves them behaving strangely in the real world, Joker and his friends once again establish the Phantom Thieves of Hearts.  After changing Alice's heart, they are approached by a police officer, Zenkichi Hasegawa, who is investigating the sudden bizarre changes of behavior in people around Japan with the Phantom Thieves as the prime suspect. Zenkichi forces them to make a deal with him: He will provide them with information necessary for their heists in exchange the Phantom Thieves help his investigation, which they reluctantly agree to. Accompanied by Zenkichi, the Phantom Thieves travel to Sendai and Sapporo, changing the corrupted hearts of the Jail's Kings. During their trip, they make a deal with a professor specializing in artificial intelligence, Kuon Ichinose, after eavesdropping and finding out that the protagonist and his friends are the Phantom Thieves. Later on, the Phantom Thieves learn that the head of the global IT Company called Madicce who developed EMMA, Akira Konoe, is misusing the app to manipulate people's hearts. He is supported by Jun Owada, a corrupt politician who once supported Masayoshi Shido, cooperating with Konoe to dispose the King of Okinawa's Jail and Zenkichi's wife. He uses his position to pin the blame on the Phantom Thieves and order for their arrest, deeming them terrorists for hacking into EMMA.  Zenkichi's daughter, Akane Hasegawa, is made a King of Kyoto's Jail when asking the app to help her after Zenkichi's been arrested for treason. Entering Kyoto's Jail upon learning of Akane's situation, the Phantom Thieves, except Futaba, are captured by Shadow Akane. Futaba requests Zenkichi's help after he is freed from custody and confronts Shadow Akane, awakening his Persona, Valjean, in the process and officially joins the Phantom Thieves. They successfully save Akane, and then requests help from Kuon Ichinose to gain more information about EMMA and Madicce, eventually allowing them to enter Konoe's Jail in Osaka. Successfully changing Konoe's heart, the EMMA app is shut down and Madicce is disbanded following Konoe's arrest.  However, the EMMA app suddenly restarts on its own, causing a massive blackout throughout Tokyo and emergence of a new Jail. Entering the Jail, they encounter Ichinose who reveals herself to be the true creator of EMMA: she sold it to Konoe so she can determine humanity's true desire. She also reveals that she created Sophia as a prototype of EMMA, but deemed her a failure and discarded her. She then commanded Sophia to attack the Phantom Thieves, but due to spending a lot of time with the Phantom Thieves and forming a bond with them, Sophia defied her creator's commands and proceeded to awaken her Persona, Pandora, to everyone's surprise. After convincing Ichinose to abandon EMMA, they learn that the application's true identity is the False God Demiurge, who believes that humanity's biggest wish is for a world free from crime and wrongdoing. It uses the EMMA app to manipulate people's hearts to take them to the Promised Land. With Ichinose's assistance, Futaba hacks into EMMA central server to send the calling card to reach Demiurge, allowing the Phantom Thieves to confront the false god and defeat it.  With Demiurge's defeat, the EMMA app is finally shut down for good, erasing Jails from existence. In the aftermath, Owada is arrested thanks to Konoe's testimony, Zenkichi returns to Kyoto, and Sophia decides to go on a journey together with Ichinose. As their mission has ended, the Phantom Thieves once again go their separate ways, but promise that they'll meet again sooner or later.  "

804,Pikuniku,/wiki/Pikuniku,Platformer,Sectordub,Devolver Digital,"January 24, 2019","January 24, 2019","January 24, 2019"," Pikuniku is a puzzle and adventure game where the player must control the protagonist, Piku, through levels and solve puzzles to progress. The majority of puzzles involve kicking and pushing objects onto switches to open doors and access rooms, allowing the player to proceed through the level. Piku can also lasso his legs to swing from hooks or curl into a ball and roll, allowing the player to move around faster and reach higher or previously inaccessible areas. Throughout the game, the player will encounter villages, where they can interact with villagers, and spend currency earned in the game's levels on items such as hats. The game also features a local cooperative mode with 9 levels, and the second player controlling Niku, an orange creature similar to Piku. Both of the players must cooperate to negotiate themselves to a boat at the end of the level.   Mr. Sunshine, a pink creature who owns a company operating flying industrial robots and acts as the game's antagonist, seeks to automate towns over the land by offering a universal basic income to all citizens of the towns who sign his contract – allowing him to take their ""trash"" (actually primary goods like corn, which the game world inhabitants grow full time) in exchange of what he calls ""free money"".  After an unnamed village's automation, Piku is awakened by a ghost in a nearby cave. As he comes out, he discovers he's actually been erroneously painted by the village's artist as a dark beast, and he is put in a cage by the frightened inhabitants. However, he is let free after it is discovered that he is virtually harmless.  Once Piku has earned the townsfolk's trust, he proceeds to explore the world, soon to be greeted by Mr. Sunshine himself on a flying robot. Along with three other people, he passively participates in a random extraction for a free tour of Mr. Sunshine's workplace. The raffle is won by one of the commoners in the crowd, a boy named Eli, who is taken to visit the magnate's secret volcano base.  Piku then travels through a swamp and reaches a forest, where he is tasked with defeating a dancing robot at a club. After witnessing an explosive attack against one of Mr. Sunshine's robots, Piku joins the Resistance, an environmental guerrilla trio of three forest villagers based in an abandoned underground metro station who intend to stop Mr. Sunshine's evil doings by destroying his robots with exploding pine cones. Piku and the Resistance march onto a lake separating the forest from the volcano base, but they discover that it has been dried out by Mr. Sunshine. They decide to reach the base by passing through a series of mines located below the surface.  A family of black worms welcomes Piku and the Resistance in the abandoned mining site. The mother, a giant worm, recounts how they have been suffering due to the lack of the lake's water, which once spilled from the pipes. Before helping Piku in any way, she asks him to rescue her child Ernie, who has become significantly overweight after drinking radioactive water from a pipe further underground. After finding Ernie and transporting him through the cave, Piku discovers the fate of an unknown civilization, who perished in a Pompeii-like eruption disaster; the creatures' shape resembles Mr. Sunshine's, but it is unknown whether he is a survivor of a natural catastrophe or if he killed his own kin with the volcano. Once Ernie is brought back to his mother, the worms assist him in destroying Mr. Sunshine's last robot in exchange for his support.  The final portion of the game takes place inside Mr. Sunshine's underground base, where he is plotting to destroy the surrounding land by covering it with lava in order to establish a new city with perfect inhabitants – although such beings are actually genetically degenerate creations with low intelligence, made by splicing the genes of the townsfolk with the forest villagers; a half of a creature of said species met by Piku in the base's laboratory may or may not have once been Eli.  After leaving the laboratory, Piku reaches a pit over live magma where Mr. Sunshine tries to have him killed. Piku avoids Mr. Sunshine's robot's lasers until his robotic henchmen piloting it go on a strike after discovering they aren't equally paid. Suddenly, Ernie comes to the rescue by rolling into the pit and letting Piku use his body as a platform to jump out of it. Piku proceeds to chase Mr. Sunshine over the magma, avoiding pop corn launched from the latter's motorboat. Upon arriving at a dead end, Mr. Sunshine decides to press the button which will make the volcano erupt, but the lava is so unexpectedly powerful – Mr. Sunshine in fact states that he meant for the lava to cover the land, not erupt like a geyser – that they are both ejected into the atmosphere on a platform.  As Piku kicks him, Mr. Sunshine is sent into space. A supposedly all-knowing being (actually the ghost from the start of the game, now manifesting itself as a room with eyes) then rescues Piku through a magic hole, informing him of his mission's outcome before sending him safely back to the base. Piku leaves along with the other Resistance members, going back to sleep in his cave off-screen.  After the story's events, the player can still explore the slightly altered post-game world to achieve all trophies, completing whatever had been left behind during the main playthrough.  "
805,Pillars of Eternity,/wiki/Pillars_of_Eternity,Role-playing,Obsidian Entertainment,Versus Evil,Unreleased,"August 8, 2019",None," Pillars of Eternity is a role-playing game that features a party-based real-time-with-pause tactical gameplay, fixed isometric user interface for the game-world with two-dimensional pre-rendered backdrops, in a similar vein as its spiritual predecessors Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale series and Planescape: Torment. As the player's characters explore an area map, it is unveiled. There is a fog of war effect on areas the player has already explored and has moved away from. The character classes and game mechanics are similar to Dungeons & Dragons, but are a proprietary system created for the game.  The game does not reward experience points for killing enemies, only for completing quests and discovering new areas. This means that non-violent approaches such as stealth are just as rewarding.  The game starts with a character creation screen where the player can choose items for their playable character, such as their physical appearance, race, and creed. The player can choose to play as one of eleven classes: fighter, rogue, ranger, barbarian, monk, paladin, wizard, druid, priest, chanter, and cipher. Each of them make the gameplay different; for example, the cipher can use the soul of an enemy in order to attack them, and druids can shapeshift into a beast and cast spells. The protagonist's class can also influence the number of available dialogue options. The player may adventure with up to five other characters out of a total of eight that they can pick up on their travels. These are fleshed out characters with unique personalities and appearances. Additionally, the protagonist can hire party members which the player creates in local taverns, but at a monetary cost.  The game has optional side quests that do not advance the main plot, which feature fleshed out supporting characters and multiple outcomes. According to a writer for Digital Spy, most of these are not ""fetch quests"". During the game, the protagonist can build up a reputation depending on their actions. Non-playable characters will react differently to him or her depending on this, and it can also affect the outcome of certain events in the game. The game features a scouting mode in which the party can sneak, which allows the player to avoid being seen by enemies. During scouting, the party can spot hidden items and traps, which the player can disarm and use against enemies.  Damage from enemies to the player's characters affect an endurance and health pool. While endurance regenerates after combat, health can only be restored by resting. The party can either set up camp, or rest in an inn. If a character in the party has their endurance drained, they are knocked out until the end of combat. If a companion has their health reduced to zero they die permanently.  The player can choose from five skills to overcome situations: Stealth, Athletics, Lore, Mechanics and Survival. As the player fights more creatures, more information is added to their bestiary. This helps the player collect information about how to attack them effectively. Early in the game, the protagonist will take over a stronghold, which acts as the party's fortress. This can be upgraded.  "

Towers have distinct attributes, such as rapid fire, long range, air-focused, etc. Destroyed enemies usually drop coins and occasionally give gems, which then can be used to upgrade and research new towers.

Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! feature common elements of the main series, such as battling non-player character Pokémon Trainers and Gym Leaders with caught Pokémon creatures. However, when facing wild Pokémon, instead of battling them with the traditional battle system like in past games, the catching of Pokémon uses a system that is reminiscent of the mobile spin-off game Pokémon Go. By using the motion controls of the Joy-Con controller or Poké Ball Plus peripheral, players can throw berries to pacify a Pokémon or Poké Balls to attempt to capture it. The action can also be performed with a button press when the Joy-Con controllers are docked to the console or in handheld mode, but this still requires using motion controls to aim. If a player uses motion controls, the catching of Pokémon is based on the player's timing rather than accuracy. Although it is possible to miss a throw, the ball is almost guaranteed to make contact with the Pokémon. One notable difference in Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! is that wild Pokémon show up in the overworld, rather than as random encounters in grass or in caves like in previous main series Pokémon role-playing games. To start an encounter with a wild Pokémon, the player must simply approach the Pokémon in the environment.  The games' control scheme is designed to only require one Joy-Con per player, and the games support cooperative multiplayer. If another player shakes a second Joy-Con, they can join the current player and are able to participate in battles with Pokémon Trainers and wild Pokémon encounters, allowing them to aid the catching of wild Pokémon. When playing multiplayer, Trainer battles become battles of two Pokémon against one, and in wild encounters, there is the possibility for each player to throw a Poké Ball at the same time, doubling the chances of capturing the Pokémon.  Depending on the version, players start with either a Pikachu or an Eevee, which sits on the player character's shoulder in the overworld. This mechanic is similar to the ""walking Pokémon"" mechanic first introduced in Pokémon Yellow, in which Pikachu followed behind the player character throughout the game. The player's partner Pokémon wiggles its tail when they are near a hidden item, and it can be dressed up for further customization. Similarly to Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, players may also choose a Pokémon to follow them, and some larger Pokémon can also be ridden, a mechanic first seen in Pokémon X and Y and later expanded on in Sun and Moon.  Since Pokémon X and Y, experience points are rewarded to Pokémon not only by defeating opponent Pokémon but also by catching wild Pokémon. However, in Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! experience points rewarded by catching wild Pokémon are affected by various multiplier bonuses depending on the timing of the throw and the technique used to throw the Poké Ball, such as performing an overarm or underarm throw. The games also introduce new items called ""candies,"" which are used to power up a Pokémon's statistics, such as hit points (HP), Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. Different types of candies are awarded to players who transfer their Pokémon to Professor Oak via an in-game storage box. ""Combat Power"" (CP) also returns from Pokémon Go.  The evolution mechanic from previous games returns in Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!. However, as with Pokémon Yellow, the player's starting Pikachu or Eevee cannot evolve; only other Pokémon that the player has caught, including ones of the same species as the partner Pokémon. Some features, like Pokémon breeding and HMs, are absent from the games.   The setting and story remains largely the same as Pokémon Yellow.

The game focuses more on action, as opposed to the more technical gameplay of Tekken, allowing both hardcore and casual fans to enjoy it. As such, players can perform various techniques taken from the Pokémon series, such as special moves and Mega Evolutions (which can be built up from attacks using a ""Synergy Gauge""). Players can also use Support Pokémon to give them special benefits such as buffs in attack or defense. First-print Wii U copies of the game were packaged with a Shadow Mewtwo Amiibo card, which immediately unlocked the character for use.

There is also a sandbox mode that allows free building without restrictions, where the parameters can be set for creation. There is a variety of vehicles, ranging from motorcycles (fast and light) to dump trucks and cranes (slow and heavy). Since every vehicle has a different body and weight, that means longer cars may not be able to drive up steep slopes and the structure might need to adapt to the situation. The game also features obstacles such as jumps and boats, forcing the player to design their bridge creatively.  A badly built bridge will collapse under the weight of a crossing vehicle.

The player's role is of both architect and governor with sandbox micromanagement themes, where he is responsible for managing various aspects of their prison including building facilities, connecting utilities, and managing staff. The player needs to recruit specific staff to unlock some aspects of the game (e.g. information about the prison's finances is unavailable without an accountant). The player is also responsible for the finances of their prison, and for meeting the needs of their prisoners (e.g. sanitation). The player is also able to implement various reform and labour programmes that reduce the specific prisoner's recidivism rate. The player tells the prisoners what to do indirectly by setting their schedule. The game takes inspiration from Theme Hospital, Dungeon Keeper, and Dwarf Fortress. The player can also allow additional conditions to be applied to their game (such as simulated temperature, gang activities and more extreme weather conditions) to increase the difficulty of the game and to simulate a prison in conditions nearer to reality. A player's prison is graded by an in-game report according to various factors, such as recidivism rate of prisoners that have left the prison, overall happiness, violence levels within the prison, et cetera.  Prisoners are also ranked according to five different classes in the base game: Minimum, Medium, Maximum, Supermax Security prisoners as well as Death Row prisoners; each different class corresponds to a different temperament and length of sentence. Death Row prisoners arrive with a 'clemency' gauge, expressed as a percentage. This percentage can be lowered with successive failed Death Row Appeal sessions; below a certain percentage, the prisoner can be executed without legal backlash to the facility regardless of the innocence of the prisoner. Should the Death Row prisoner pass an appeal, he may be released from the prison or transferred into the general prison population.  Players may also opt to build a female prison, which necessitates the construction of nursing and childcare facilities for female inmates that are pregnant or are accompanying an infant.  Players can be 'fired' by the CEO by reaching a Failure Condition, and the player is then prevented from further managing that prison. Failure Conditions include:  The first ""official"" (non-beta) release introduced an expanded story mode as a tutorial as well as an escape mode which casts the player as a prisoner with the goal of escaping, while causing as much trouble as possible.  With the addition of the Psych Ward DLC, players are given the option to house criminally insane prisoners, and build relevant facilities to meet their needs (such as padded cells), and hire additional personnel needed to keep them in check, such as orderlies and psychiatrists. Additionally, regular prisoners may become criminally insane when they experience excessive punishment or when their needs are not regularly met (such as lack of access to food or sanitation).  "

The player manages the boxer around the clock through various locations in a city, including his home, the boxing gym, stores, and his work place. Time progresses when the player is involved in any activity, including moving between these locations.  The boxer character has three primary attributes that contribute towards his skill in boxing and how other boxers are compared: strength, agility, and stamina. These attributes start at one but can be increased by performing various activities, such as exercising or going to work. However, performing these activities will wear away at other attributes, including hunger, alertness, and happiness, and if these attributes are too low, some activities may not be available. These lesser attributes can be regained through eating, sleeping, and other events, though the main boxing attributes will slowly degrade with game time. The boxer will gain friends or other associates over the course of the game which will help also lead the character towards resolving the mystery of his father's murder, perform new activities to help raise the primary attributes, or aid in boosting the lesser attributes. Further, many activities require in-game money, which the player earns through performing work or by winning boxing matches. Thus, the player must determine how to balance the character's activities with the limited in-game time to maintain sufficiently high boxing attributes as to advance up in the boxing ranks. The game has a quest system, but many quests are optional. The game has several possible endings, depending on choices players make.  When the player opts to send the character into a fight, or when the character is forced to fight, the game then allows the player to equip the boxer with a limited number of boxing skills that they have learned to that point including punches, kicks, and blocks; these skills can be swapped out between boxing rounds and these kicks and punches crushes enemy stamina and help occupy a limited number of slots, which brings in a smart, simple and strategic layer to Punch Club. Opponents will also have a similar set of skills, which the player can examine between rounds. Some skills require the player to have a high enough primary attribute to be used, while the effect of others is based on the value of these attributes. Once the player has selected these skills, the round is executed automatically by the computer during the next round. The moves for each fighter during the round are randomly drawn from those selected. The goal is to reduce the health of the opponent to zero before the boxer's is reduced, or before twenty rounds are completed, in which a decision is made by the game as to who won the match. New skills are gained as the player completes more of the game, making them a more adept fighter.  The game itself is written with numerous references to 80s and 90s fighting movies, including references to the Rocky films, Fight Club, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and other works.  "

In the Puyo Puyo style, colored blobs known as Puyos will fall from the top of the screen and can be rotated before being placed down. The Puyos can be popped by matching four and more of the same color next to each other. By carefully arranging the Puyos, players can perform chain combos in which additional Puyos are matched and popped as they fall into place, earning more points as a result. The Tetris style, on the other hand, has players placing shaped blocks known as Tetriminoes down on the playing field. Successfully filling a complete horizontal line of blocks on the field will make it disappear, and additional points can be earned clearing multiple lines at once. In Puyo style, the game ends if a Puyo reaches the X mark. In Tetris style, the game ends if Tetriminos pile up over the top of the playing field.  Using these two gameplay styles, Puyo Puyo Tetris features five main game modes, each of which can be played with up to four players, both locally or online, or against computer opponents. With the exception of Swap and Fusion modes, each player can independently choose between Puyo and Tetris styles. Versus mode is a standard match in which players face off against each other with their chosen style. By performing chain combos in Puyo style or clearing lines in Tetris style, garbage is sent over to the player's opponents, which appears as Garbage Puyos in Puyo style and added lines in Tetris style. Players lose once their playing field is filled over the top. Party mode throws in power-ups that can give the player benefits or hinder opponents. The player who has the highest score at the end of a time limit wins, and players won't be eliminated from filling up the board in this mode. Swap mode has the players periodically alternate between Puyo and Tetris styles, each on its own board. Players lose when one of their board becomes completely filled. Fusion mode combines both Puyo and Tetris styles onto one board, with Tetrinimoes sinking below any Puyos when placed. Finally, Big Bang mode combines Fever mode from Puyo Puyo with Lucky Attack from Tetris. Depending on the style, players must quickly clear waves of pre-arranged Puyos or Tetris blocks, aiming to clear as many waves as possible within a time limit. After each time limit, players are dealt damage depending on how much slower they were against the leading player, with players eliminated if they run out of health. There is also an Adventure story more campaign consisting of various battles against computer opponents and mode-specific challenges, and six single-player Challenge modes; Endless Fever, Endless Puyo, and Tiny Puyo for the Puyo style; Sprint, Marathon, and Ultra for the Tetris style. Playing through each mode earns credits that can be spent in an in-game shop to unlock different art styles for Puyos and Tetriminoes and alternate voice packs.  "

The game has a very fast approach to the turn-based mechanic, and while the player does have to wait for the enemies to take turn, everything is done very quickly to keep the action fluid. Each turn the player may move or attack monsters in adjacent squares, pick, drop, and use items, and interact with various in-game objects. Permanent death is a major part of the game, in which if the player dies by losing all HP it will restart from the beginning of the game, thus creating a different dungeon, there are no options inside the game to change this, so while the player can save and continue later at any moment, if he dies he can't continue.   The game doesn't take itself very seriously and makes fun of the traditional plots. In this case, an Evil Dark Lord steals all the light in the world and traps it inside a magical lantern. The four heroes decide that it would be a good idea if one of them enters alone. This is a nod to B movie plots where sometimes characters make the most illogical decision.  "

Lums can be collected by touching them, defeating enemies, or freeing captured Teensies. Collecting Teensies unlocks new worlds, which can be played in any order once they are available. Along with Rayman, Globox, and the Teensies returning as playable characters, players can now control new female character Barbara and her sisters, once they are rescued from certain stages.  In addition to the main playable characters, Murfy the greenbottle, who first appeared in Rayman 2: The Great Escape, appears as an assist character. Murfy can perform various actions such as cutting through ropes, activating mechanisms, grabbing hold of enemies and assisting in gathering Lums. These offer a range of levels in which co-operation is required to progress. In the Wii U, PlayStation Vita, and PlayStation 4 versions of the game, an additional player can control Murfy directly with touch controls, using the Wii U GamePad, the Vita's front touch screen, and the Dual Shock 4 touchpad respectively. In single-player mode, control will switch over to Murfy during certain sections whilst the computer controls the player's character. In the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC versions of the game, Murfy moves automatically and can be prompted to interact with certain objects with button controls. Other new features include sections where players can fire projectile fists at enemies and rhythm based levels set to covers of songs such as ""Black Betty"", ""Eye of the Tiger"", ""Woo-Hoo"", and ""Antisocial"".  The game features over 120 levels, including 40 remastered levels from the original Rayman Origins, which are unlocked by obtaining Lucky Tickets, which can also win additional Lums and Teensies. Some levels feature remixed 'Invaded' versions, which must be completed as quickly as possible. The game also offers daily and weekly challenge stages, in which players can compete with other players via leaderboards in challenges such as collecting a certain number of Lums in a short time, or surviving the longest on a stage. More challenge stages can be accessed by raising the player's 'awesomeness' rating, which increases by collecting trophies earned by rescuing Teensies, collecting a high number of Lums in each level or by having a high leaderboard position at the end of a challenge. A local multiplayer football game, Kung Foot, is also featured, in which players use attacks to knock a football into the opponent's goal.   Its plot takes place one century after the events of Rayman Origins. Rayman, Globox and the Teensies have been sleeping for a century. During that time, the Bubble Dreamer's nightmares grew in strength and numbers, and so has the Magician (who has survived the explosion in Rayman Origins), who has split into 5 ""Dark Teensies"". Rayman and friends are awakened by their friend Murfy who tells them about the bad news, and tells them that the 10 princesses of the land (including Barbara) and the Teensies have been captured by the nightmares and the Dark Teensies. Rayman, Globox, the Teensies, and Murfy set out to defeat these new threats. After defeating 4 of the Dark Teensies and fighting the worst of the nightmares, Rayman and friends go to Olympus Maximus and confront a giant cloud of pure nightmare. After the darkness has been destroyed and the last Dark Teensie is sent to the moon, the credits roll. If four-hundred teensies are saved, the player unlocks the last world of the game, Living Dead Party. Once completed, the nightmares are defeated and the player is awarded with 10,000 lums and 6 new invasion paintings. Once the player saves all 700 (or 826 for NS version) Teensies, they unlock the golden Teensie.  "

There are five racing complexes (and an additional seven have been added via DLC) each one consisting of five tracks. Track design includes loops, jumps, teleports, underwater sections, tubular sections and tracks with low or no gravity.

Multiplayer is supported online via lobbies of up to twelve players and locally via two players split-screen.

To advance, the player must explore a mansion and its surrounding areas while avoiding, outsmarting and defeating monsters including zombies, undead dogs, and giant spiders. The player can open doors, push certain objects, climb obstacles, and pick up items. When an item is collected, it is stored in an inventory that the player can access at any time. Items in the inventory can be used, examined, and combined to solve puzzles and gain access to areas that were previously inaccessible. The inventory is limited to a certain number of slots, and the player must often move items from the inventory to storage boxes located in certain areas to manage space.  Although the player can use firearms to kill monsters, Resident Evil emphasizes evasion over fast-paced combat by providing the player with limited ammunition. The player has a limited amount of health, which decreases when attacked by monsters. Players can regain health by collecting and using herbs, which can be mixed with other herbs to increase their healing effect. Some monsters can also infect the player with a poisoning effect, which gradually depletes the player's health over time until the poison is cured with serum or special herbs. Zombies that are defeated but not decapitated or burned eventually revive and mutate into deadlier forms.  The player can control either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine, each with advantages and disadvantages. For example, Chris can take and deal more damage than Jill, but Jill can carry more items and unlock certain doors with a lock pick. Both characters can equip defensive weapons that can save them from taking damage when seized by an enemy. These defensive weapons include a dagger and a unique special weapon: Jill can use a taser, while Chris can shove stun grenades into zombies' mouths and detonate them with a pistol shot. Defensive weapons are limited and can only be used when the player is grabbed by a monster.  The game features an automap to help players navigate the different areas of the game. Additionally, the player can pick up maps of certain sections to reveal unexplored areas. To save their progress, players need to find ink ribbons and use them with a typewriter; the game features a limited supply of ink ribbons, so players cannot save their progress as many times as they want. The story is slightly altered by the character the player chooses to play as, and certain choices the player makes in the game can impact the direction of the game and its ending. Upon completing the game under a certain difficulty setting and time limit, the player may unlock secret costumes for the main characters, bonus weapons, and special difficulty modes.   On July 24, 1998, a series of bizarre murders occur on the outskirts of the Midwestern town of Raccoon City. The Raccoon City Police Department's Special Tactics And Rescue Service (STARS) are assigned to investigate. After contact with Bravo Team is lost, Alpha Team is sent to investigate their disappearance. Alpha Team locates Bravo Team's crashed helicopter and land at the site, where they are attacked by a pack of monstrous dogs, killing one of the team. After Alpha Team's helicopter pilot, Brad Vickers, panics and takes off alone, the remaining members (Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, Albert Wesker and Barry Burton) seek refuge in an abandoned mansion, where they split up.  The player character (Chris or Jill) finds several members of Bravo Team, including Kenneth J. Sullivan being eaten by a zombie; Richard Aiken, who is either killed by a giant venomous snake or eaten by a shark; Forest Speyer, who is found dead and revived as a zombie; and Bravo Team leader Enrico Marini, who reveals that one of Alpha Team's members is a traitor before being killed by an unseen shooter. Bravo Team survivor Rebecca Chambers joins Chris. The player character learns that a series of illegal experiments were undertaken by a clandestine research team under the authority of a biomedical company Umbrella Corporation. The creatures roaming the mansion and its surrounding areas are the results of these experiments, which have exposed the mansion's personnel and animals to a highly contagious and mutagenic biological agent known as the T-virus.  The player character discovers a secret underground laboratory containing Umbrella's experiments. There, they find Jill or Chris in a cell and encounter Wesker programming a Tyrant, a humanoid supersoldier. Wesker reveals that he is a double agent working for Umbrella, and plans to use the Tyrant to kill the STARS members. In the ensuing confrontation, Wesker is apparently killed and the player character defeats the Tyrant. After activating the lab's self-destruct system, the player character reaches the heliport and contacts Brad for extraction. The ending changes depending on the player's actions at key points: in the best ending, the surviving team members escape by helicopter after defeating the Tyrant again; in the worst ending, the mansion remains intact and the player character is the sole survivor.

874,Resident Evil Zero HD Remaster,/wiki/Resident_Evil_Zero#HD_Remaster,Survival horror,Capcom,Capcom,"May 23, 2019","May 21, 2019","May 21, 2019"," Resident Evil Zero is a third-person survival horror video game. The gameplay remains largely the same as previous entries in the series. However, unlike controlling one sole character like the previous games, the player controls two protagonists throughout the game. The player may switch between police officer and medic Rebecca Chambers and convicted former Force Reconnaissance Officer Billy Coen. If they travel together, either one of them can be controlled while the other character is handled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). The player may also control both simultaneously or split them up to explore areas separately. Each character has unique abilities. Rebecca has a mixing kit which allows her to combine herbs and other chemicals, but she is weak defensively. In contrast, Billy can move heavy objects, use a lighter, and has higher defense, but cannot mix herbs (a staple ability in Resident Evil games). The partner system is central to solving many of the game's puzzles.:17  The characters can run as well as perform quick 180-degree turns to evade danger. The player may examine objects such as doors, other characters, and items in order to find clues to proceed through the game. Some objects can be pushed or climbed upon to investigate higher levels.:8 Items held by the characters can be examined in the inventory screen. Some items such as weapons can be equipped, and other items can be combined together to create more effective items or replenish ammunition. When Rebecca and Billy are close by, they can exchange items between one-another.:10–12 Previous series installments had the player store items in boxes placed in fixed locations. Resident Evil Zero has no item boxes, and instead allows players to drop items on the floor, freeing space in the inventory momentarily until they are retrieved at a later point. The locations of dropped items are displayed on the game map. The number of items that can be discarded in a room is limited.:10–12   On July 23, 1998, a train owned by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella, the Ecliptic Express, comes under attack from a swarm of leeches. As the passengers and crew are attacked, a mysterious young man watches over the resulting chaos from a hillside. Two hours later, the Bravo Team of the Special Tactics And Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.) police force is sent to investigate a series of cannibalistic murders in the Arklay Mountains outside of Raccoon City. On the way to the scene, its helicopter has an engine failure and crash-lands in a forest. While searching the immediate area, Officer Rebecca Chambers of Bravo Team comes across the Express, now motionless, and explores it, only to find the passengers and crew transformed into zombies, unaware their transformation was a result of exposure to Umbrella's T-Virus contained within the leeches. As she explores the train for answers, she teams up with Billy Coen—a former Marine Force Reconnaissance officer, who was to be executed for killing 23 people until the military police van transporting him crashed within the region.  The pair soon notices the same mysterious young man, moments before the train suddenly begins moving again. Unbeknownst to the pair, two soldiers from Umbrella, on the orders of Albert Wesker and William Birkin, attempt to take control of the train and destroy it but are killed by leeches before they can complete their mission. As the train speeds out of control, Rebecca and Billy apply the brakes and avert its course towards an abandoned building. Upon exploring the area, they discover it to be a disused training facility for future executives of Umbrella, and that the former director of the facility and the corporation's co-founder, Dr. James Marcus, was responsible for discovering the so-called Progenitor virus in the 1960s, and decided to examine its potential as a biological weapon. He combined it with leech DNA to develop the T-Virus that causes rapid mutations in living organisms and thus transforms humans and animals into zombies and monsters.  As the pair continue to explore the facility, Wesker decides to leave Umbrella and join its rival company, and makes plans for further research on the t-Virus, while Birkin refuses his offer to join him, instead opting to complete his research on the G-virus. Later, Rebecca becomes separated from Billy. On her own, she encounters Captain Enrico Marini, who tells her that the rest of the Bravo team will meet up at an old mansion they found but allows her to stay behind to find Billy. Just after Enrico leaves, Rebecca is attacked by the Tyrant. After temporarily defeating the Tyrant, Rebecca meets up with Billy again, and together they defeat it and continue on towards a water plant.  Eventually, Rebecca and Billy catch up with the leech-controlling man who happens to be Marcus' final experiment, Queen Leech. Ten years ago, Marcus was assassinated on the orders of Umbrella's other co-founder, Oswell E. Spencer, who sought his research. After his corpse was dumped, Queen Leech entered his body and reanimated it, gaining his memories and the ability to shapeshift, whereupon it believed itself to be Marcus and orchestrated the T-Virus outbreak in the facility and on the train as a means of revenge against Umbrella. After temporarily defeating it, Billy and Rebecca attempt to escape to the surface via a lift, tripping the facility's self-destruct mechanism. Pursued by Queen Leech, the pair eventually kills it and escape before the facility is destroyed. Following their escape, Rebecca notices the mansion that Marini mentioned and prepares to head for it. Before she does, she assures Billy that her police report will list him as another casualty of the incident. Thanking her for his freedom, Billy departs as Rebecca heads towards the mansion to seek out the whereabouts of her fellow Bravo Team members (seen in Resident Evil).  "
875,Resident Evil 4,/wiki/Resident_Evil_4,Survival horror,Capcom,Capcom,"May 23, 2019","May 21, 2019","May 21, 2019"," The player controls the protagonist, Leon S. Kennedy, from a third-person perspective. Departing significantly from the series' previous games, the gameplay focuses on action and shootouts with fewer survival horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no crosshair for firearms; instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up, or down, players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, and shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons. Players can also shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.  Resident Evil 4 adds context-sensitive controls. Based on the situation, players can interact with the environment: kicking down a ladder, jumping out of a window, dodging an attack or executing a ""finishing move"" on weakened enemies. There are also quick time events, in which the player must press buttons indicated on-screen to execute actions such as dodging a falling boulder or wrestling an enemy to stay alive. These are often incorporated into the game's many boss fights, in which the player must avoid instant-kill attacks.  The main enemies are violent villagers referred to as Los Ganados (""The Cattle"" in Spanish). Los Ganados can dodge, wield melee and projectile weapons, and are capable of working collectively and communicating with each other.  The inventory system features a grid system, represented by an attaché case, that has each item take up a certain number of spaces. The case can be upgraded several times, allowing for more space. Weapons, ammunition, and healing items are kept in the case, while key items and treasures are kept in a separate menu. Items may be bought from and sold to a merchant that appears in various locations. He sells first aid sprays, weapons, allows for weapons to be upgraded and buys various treasures that Leon finds. The various weapons each have their own advantages and disadvantages.  Capcom added content for the PlayStation 2 version, which was later incorporated into the PC and Wii releases. The largest addition is ""Separate Ways"", a minigame which focuses on Ada Wong's involvement in Resident Evil 4 and her connection to the series' villain Albert Wesker. ""Ada's Report"", a five-part documentary, analyzes Ada's relationship with Wesker and his role in the plot. Other unlockable content in all versions includes the minigames ""The Mercenaries"" and ""Assignment Ada"" (using Ada to retrieve Las Plagas samples), new costumes for Leon and Ashley, new weapons, and a cutscene browser.   In 2004, six years after the events of Resident Evil 2, former Raccoon City police officer turned U.S. government agent Leon S. Kennedy (Paul Mercier) is sent on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham (Carolyn Lawrence), the U.S. President's daughter, who has been kidnapped by a mysterious cult. He travels to a nameless rural village in Spain, where he encounters a group of hostile villagers who pledge their lives to Los Illuminados (""The Enlightened Ones"" in Spanish), the cult that kidnapped Ashley. The villagers were once simple farmers until becoming infected by a mind-controlling parasite known as Las Plagas (""The Plague"" in Spanish).  While in the village, Leon is captured by its chief, Bitores Mendez, and injected with Las Plagas. He finds himself held captive with Luis Sera (Rino Romano), a former Los Illuminados researcher. The two work together to escape, but soon go their separate ways. Leon finds out Ashley is being held in a church and rescues her. They both escape from the church after Osmund Saddler (Michael Gough), leader of Los Illuminados, reveals his plan to use the plaga they injected into Ashley to manipulate her into injecting the president of the United States with the ""sample"" (a Master Plaga) once she returns home, allowing Saddler to begin his conquest of the world.  After killing Mendez, Leon and Ashley try to take refuge in a castle but are attacked by more Illuminados under the command of Ramon Salazar (Rene Mujica), another of Saddler's henchmen who owns the castle, and the two become separated by Salazar's traps. Meanwhile, Luis searches for pills that will slow Leon and Ashley's infection, as well as a sample of Las Plagas. He brings the two items to Leon but is killed by Saddler, who takes the sample, while the pills to suppress the infection remain in Leon's hands. While in the castle, Leon briefly encounters Ada Wong (Sally Cahill), a woman from his past who supports him during his mission. He battles his way through the castle before killing Salazar.  Afterward, Leon travels to a nearby island research facility, where he continues the search for Ashley. He discovers that one of his former training comrades, Jack Krauser (Jim Ward), who was believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash two years prior, is responsible for her kidnapping. It is revealed that both Ada and Krauser are working with Albert Wesker (Richard Waugh), for whom both intend to secure a Plagas sample. Suspicious of the mercenary's intentions, Saddler orders Krauser to kill Leon, believing that no matter which one dies, he will benefit. After Krauser's fatal defeat, Leon rescues Ashley, and they remove the Plagas from their bodies using a specialized radiotherapeutic device. Leon confronts Saddler, and with Ada's help, manages to kill him. However, Ada takes the sample from Leon at gunpoint before escaping in a helicopter, leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her jet-ski as the island explodes.  "
876,Resident Evil 5,/wiki/Resident_Evil_5,Third-person shooter,Capcom,Capcom,"October 31, 2019","October 29, 2019","October 29, 2019"," In 2009, five years after the events of Resident Evil 4,  Chris Redfield, a member of the fictional Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA), is dispatched to Kijuju in Africa. He and his new partner Sheva Alomar are tasked with apprehending Ricardo Irving before he can sell a bio-organic weapon (BOW) on the black market. When they arrive, they discover that the locals have been infected by the parasites Las Plagas (those infected are called ""Majini"") and the BSAA Alpha Team have been killed. Chris and Sheva are rescued by BSAA's Delta Team, which includes Sheva's mentor Josh Stone. In Stone's data Chris sees a photograph of Jill Valentine, his old partner, who has been presumed dead after a confrontation with Albert Wesker. Chris, Sheva and Delta Team close in on Irving, but he escapes with the aid of a hooded figure. Irving leaves documents that lead Chris and Sheva to marshy oilfields. This is where Irving's deal is to occur, but they discover that the documents are a diversion. When Chris and Sheva try to regroup with Delta Team, they find the team slaughtered by a BOW; Sheva cannot find Stone among the dead. Determined to learn if Valentine is still alive, Chris does not report to headquarters.  Continuing through the marsh, they find Stone injured but safe and track down Irving's boat with his help. Irving injects himself with a variant of the Las Plagas parasite and mutates into a huge octopus-like beast. Chris and Sheva defeat him, and his dying words lead them to a nearby cave to learn more. The cave is the source of a flower used to create viruses previously used by the Umbrella Corporation, as well as a new strain named Uroboros. Chris and Sheva find evidence that Tricell, the company funding the BSAA, took over a former Umbrella underground laboratory and continued Umbrella's research. In the facility, they discover thousands of capsules holding human test subjects. Although Chris finds that one of the capsules is Valentine's, it is empty. When they leave, they discover that Tricell CEO Excella Gionne has been plotting with Wesker to launch missiles with the Uroboros virus across the globe; it is eventually revealed that Wesker hopes to take a chosen few from the chaos of infection and rule them, creating a new breed of humanity. Chris and Sheva pursue Gionne but are stopped by Wesker and the hooded figure, who is revealed to be a mind-controlled Valentine. Gionne and Wesker escape to a Tricell oil tanker; Chris and Sheva fight Valentine, subduing her and removing the mind-control device before she orders Chris to follow Wesker.  Chris and Sheva board the tanker and encounter Gionne, who escapes after dropping a case of syringes; Sheva keeps several. When Chris and Sheva reach the main deck, Wesker announces over the ship's intercom that he has betrayed Gionne and infected her with Uroboros. She mutates into a giant monster, which Chris and Sheva defeat. Valentine radios in, telling Chris and Sheva that Wesker must take precise, regular doses of a virus to maintain his strength and speed; a larger or smaller dose would poison him. Sheva realizes that Gionne's syringes are doses of the drug. Chris and Sheva follow Wesker to a bomber loaded with missiles containing the Uroboros virus, injecting him with the syringes Gionne dropped. Wesker tries to escape on the bomber; Chris and Sheva disable it, making him crash-land in a volcano. Furious‚ Wesker exposes himself to Uroboros and chases Chris and Sheva through the volcano. They fight him, and the weakened Wesker falls into the lava before Chris and Sheva are rescued by a helicopter, which is piloted by Valentine and Stone. As a dying Wesker attempts to drag the helicopter into the volcano, Chris and Sheva fire rocket-propelled grenades at Wesker, killing him. In the game's final cutscene, Chris wonders if the world is worth fighting for. Looking at Sheva and Valentine, he decides to live in a world without fear.   Resident Evil 5 is a third-person shooter with an over-the-shoulder perspective. Players can use several weapons including handguns, shotguns, automatic rifles, sniper rifles, and grenade launchers, as well as melee attacks. Players can make quick 180-degree turns to evade enemies. The game involves boss battles, many of which contain quick time events.  As in its predecessor Resident Evil 4, players can upgrade weapons with money and treasure collected in-game and heal themselves with herbs, but cannot run and shoot at the same time. New features include infected enemies with guns and grenades, the ability to upgrade weapons at any time from the inventory screen without having to find a merchant, and the equipping of weapons and items in real-time during gameplay. Each player can store nine items. Unlike the previous games, the item size is irrelevant; a herb or a grenade launcher each occupy one space, and four items may be assigned to the D-pad. The game features puzzles, though fewer than previous titles.  Resident Evil 5 is the first game in the Resident Evil series designed for two-player cooperative gameplay. The player controls Chris, a former member of the fictional Special Tactics and Rescue Service (STARS) and member of the BSAA, and a second player can control Sheva, who is introduced in this game. If a person plays alone, Sheva is controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). When the game has been completed once, there is an option to make Sheva the primary character. Two-player mode is available online or split screen with a second player using the same console. A second player joining a split screen game in progress will make the game reload the last checkpoint (the point at which the game was last saved); the second player joining an online game will have to wait until the first player reaches the next checkpoint, or restarts the previous one, to play. In split-screen mode, one player's viewpoint is presented in the top half of the screen, and the other in the bottom half, but each viewpoint is presented in widescreen format, rather than using the full width of the screen, resulting in unused space to the left and right of the two windows. If one player has critical health, only their partner can resuscitate them, and they will die if their partner cannot reach them. At certain points, players are deliberately separated. Players can trade items during gameplay, although weapons cannot be traded with online players. The game's storyline is linear, and interaction with other characters is mostly limited to cutscenes.  A version of the Mercenaries minigame, which debuted in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, is included in Resident Evil 5. This minigame places the player in an enclosed environment with a time limit. Customized weapons cannot be used and players must search for weapons, ammunition, and time bonuses while fighting a barrage of enemies, to score as many points as possible within the time limit. The minigame multiplayer mode was initially offline only; a release-day patch needed to be downloaded to access the online multiplayer modes. Mercenaries is unlocked when the game's story mode has been completed.  "
877,Resident Evil 6,/wiki/Resident_Evil_6,Third-person shooter,Capcom,Capcom,"October 31, 2019","October 29, 2019","October 29, 2019"," Resident Evil 6 allows players to select between four scenarios with interwoven storylines centered on Division of Security Operations (DSO) agent Leon S. Kennedy, Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA) Captain Chris Redfield, mercenary Jake Muller, and spy Ada Wong. In the Leon, Chris, and Jake scenarios, players have the option of controlling either them or their respective partners, United States Secret Service agent Helena Harper, BSAA sniper Piers Nivans, and DSO agent Sherry Birkin. The character not selected by the player is controlled by either artificial intelligence (AI) or another player via local or online multiplayer. Ada's scenario can be played with or without a partner and a second player who joins will control the non-canonical character Agent. In addition, each scenario features a different play-style; for example, some player-characters are more vulnerable to attacks whereas others are more resilient. Each central character has unique abilities, which vary from increased reload times and carrying more ammunition. Resident Evil 6 presents new gameplay mechanics such as rolling in any direction and running while shooting and sliding. The game also features a four-player co-operative mode. When playing in single player mode, the player can allow another player to join in online at any time. While performing certain actions, quick time events may occur, in which the player must follow onscreen prompts by pressing buttons or manipulating joysticks within a limited amount of time.  A new feature comes in the form of tablets; players may consume them in order to recover health, and more can be produced by mixing herbs. If one player runs out of health, that player will have a short time to try to defend themselves while their partners attempt to revive them. If any non-AI players are killed, gameplay will resume at the last checkpoint. The game features several primary enemies, including zombies and the newly introduced J'avo. Unlike zombies, J'avo are able to interact with each other to plan an attack, use weapons, and heal themselves. Also some J'avo are susceptible to various mutations that increase their prowess in battle, the type of mutation sometimes depends on location of the injury. There are a total of 15 different mutations within the game. Certain enemies drop skill points when killed, which can be picked up and spent on upgrades such as increased weapon effectiveness or specific ammunition drops. The campaigns feature a ""Lone Wolf"" ability which allows the player to remove their artificial intelligence companion character. Players can equip three of these upgrades which apply to all campaigns. The game also features a stamina bar; which depletes once the player performs melee attacks, or uses a ""quickshot"" — which involves shooting a zombie with a headshot instantly. Resident Evil 6 is twice as long as Resident Evil 5.  The game features two new modes. ""Mercenaries"" mode involves players fighting for survival against hordes of enemies. In the PC version, the Mercenaries mode features an exclusive sub-mode named ""No Mercy"", which involves the cast from Left 4 Dead 2 fighting a total number of 300 enemies against a timer. ""Agent Hunt"" mode allows players to take control of random enemies in other people's online sessions, however it is only unlocked after the player clears the three main campaigns. The longer the player stays in another online session, the more points they will earn.   On 24 December 2012, Jake Muller (Troy Baker), son of late bio-terrorist Albert Wesker, flees local authorities during a bio-terrorist attack in Edonia. He partners with Division of Security Operations (DSO) agent and Raccoon City survivor Sherry Birkin (Eden Riegel) and learns that she is to extract him from the country to create a vaccine for the new C-virus. However, they are hunted by Ustanak, a hulking bio-weapon. Meanwhile, a Bio-terrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA) strike team led by Chris Redfield (Roger Craig Smith) and Piers Nivans (Christopher Emerson) is deployed to combat the infected local populace. However, they are attacked by the leader of Neo-Umbrella, who refers to herself as Ada Wong (Courtenay Taylor); she kills most of the BSAA members, using a device that injects them with the C-virus, turning them into monsters, except Chris and Piers. Chris goes into a self-imposed exile, afflicted with post-traumatic amnesia. Meanwhile, Sherry and Jake's extraction by the BSAA is sabotaged, forcing them to crash into the mountains. They are captured by ""Ada"" for six months.  On 29 June 2013, US President Adam Benford (Michael Donovan) attempts to publicly reveal the truth behind the 1998 Raccoon City incident and the government's dealings with Umbrella, to end further bio-terrorist activity. However, the venue in the American town of Tall Oaks is hit by another attack, infecting the President; the sole survivors, DSO agent and Raccoon City survivor Leon S. Kennedy (Matthew Mercer) and United States Secret Service agent Helena Harper (Laura Bailey), are forced to kill him. The pair encounter the real Ada Wong (also Taylor), and Leon learns that National Security Advisor Derek Simmons (David Lodge) is affiliated with Neo-Umbrella and was responsible for the attack. Leon and Helena pursue Simmons into Lanshiang, China, while faking their deaths. Meanwhile, Jake and Sherry escape captivity in Lanshiang.  Chris returns to duty in the BSAA with Piers and a new team, arriving in a besieged Lanshiang. Chris recovers from his amnesia and seeks revenge against Ada, resulting in casualties for his squad. Chris and Piers confront Ada, until Leon intervenes. After being informed by Leon, Chris and Piers pursue ""Ada"" to an aircraft carrier, destroying cruise missiles laden with the C-virus. Leon, Helena, Sherry, and Jake confront Simmons over his involvement with the outbreaks, where Sherry covertly hands Jake's medical data to Leon in case of their captivity. Leon and Helena corner Simmons, who has been infected by a J'avo, where he confesses to having killed the President to maintain national security. The two see off a mutated Simmons while Sherry and Jake are captured again. Attempting to leave the city, Leon and Helena are warned by Chris that a missile has been launched, but they are too late to stop it. Leon discloses Jake's real identity to Chris and has him rescue Jake and Sherry in a remote oil platform. With Ada's assistance, Leon and Helena kill Simmons.  On the oil platform, Chris and Piers head underground, freeing Jake and Sherry from captivity before preventing a large-scale attack by a gigantic bioweapon, Haos. Heavily wounded, and in a desperate attempt to save Chris, Piers injects himself with the C-virus to help turn the tide of the battle. He defeats Haos before evacuating. Aware that the mutation will worsen, Piers sacrifices himself by pushing Chris to an escape pod, using his abilities to destroy the base. Meanwhile, Jake and Sherry escape the facility and kill Ustanak as they ride a rocket-powered lift to the surface.  The imposter Ada was a scientist named Carla Radames, who was forced to transform into Ada by Simmons. The real Ada was aiding Leon and Sherry while destroying the Neo-Umbrella lab in Langshiang. Although presumed dead after being shot by one of Simmons' soldiers, Carla attempts a final attack against Ada, after having injected herself with a powerful dose of the C-virus, but is killed. After aiding Leon and Helena in their battle with Simmons, Ada destroys the lab where her clone was developed, and accepts a new assignment. Leon and Helena are cleared for duty; Chris remains with the BSAA in command of a new squad, overcoming his guilt; Sherry continues her duty as a DSO agent; and Jake starts a new life fighting B.O.W.s in an underdeveloped country with his identity covered up by the BSAA.

879,Resident Evil Revelations,/wiki/Resident_Evil_Revelations,Survival horror,Capcom,Capcom,"November 30, 2017","November 28, 2017","November 28, 2017"," Resident Evil: Revelations is a survival horror game where the player controls the on-screen character from a third-person perspective to interact with the environment and enemies. In the game's single-player campaign, the player must complete a series of scenarios collected together into episodes. Most of the scenarios involve the player controlling Jill Valentine aboard a ghost ship in the Mediterranean Sea, but some require the player to play as other characters in different settings. To finish a scenario and proceed to the next one, the player must complete certain objectives such as solving puzzles, defeating a boss, collecting keys that open doors to new areas, and reaching a specific point in the game, among others.  As a survival horror game, Revelations emphasizes survival, evasion, and exploration over fast-paced combat by providing the player with limited ammunition, health, and movement speed. The player has the ability to run, climb ladders, swim and dive underwater for a limited period of time. Up to three firearms can be carried at one time, in addition to grenades and the standard combat knife. Firearms range from handguns to shotguns, submachine guns and rifles. When aiming a firearm to shoot enemies, the gameplay switches into either a first-person or an over-the-shoulder perspective. As Valentine, the player can upgrade firearms by finding special items throughout the game. The player may also perform melee attacks when an enemy has been stunned after being shot at the right time. Ammunition and health suppliers are dispersed among the game to help players increase their resources. A device called Genesis can be used to scan and find items hidden throughout the game's environments. An automap feature is available to help players navigate the game.  In addition to the single-player campaign, Revelations offers a more action-oriented mode, called Raid Mode, where one or two players may fight their way through a selection of altered scenarios from the single-player campaign. These usually feature enemies of varying power for the player to defeat. Once a scenario has been completed, the player is rewarded with experience and battle points that can be exchanged for various weapons and items at a store. Gaining experience and acquiring new equipment allow players to progress to higher and more challenging scenarios. As the player progresses throughout the game, the player may also unlock numerous characters for use in both the single-player campaign and Raid Mode, with each character having a different set of abilities and melee attack. The game supports a StreetPass functionality that allows different players to exchange items for use in the game.   Revelations is set between Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5, shortly after the establishment of the counter-terrorism group Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA). One year prior to the game's events, the Federal Bioterrorism Commission (FBC) sent agents Parker Luciani and Jessica Sherawat to keep the city of Terragrigia under control after the bioterrorist organization Il Veltro launched an attack using genetically modified living creatures in opposition to Terragrigia's solar energy development. In the present, BSAA head Clive R. O'Brian sends out BSAA agents Jill Valentine and Parker to search for BSAA agents Chris Redfield and Jessica at their last known location, the cruise ship Queen Zenobia in the Mediterranean Sea. They have reportedly gone missing during their mission to investigate Veltro's possible reappearance.  Aboard the ship, Jill and Parker enter a room where they believe Chris is being held, realizing too late that it was a trap set by a Veltro operative. Meanwhile, Chris and Jessica find a base of operations for Veltro; the Valkoinen Mökki airstrip in the mountains. Being informed by O'Brian that Jill and Parker are missing in the Mediterranean, they are redeployed to investigate their whereabouts. O'Brian also sends BSAA agents Quint Cetcham and Keith Lumley to Valkoinen Mökki to gather information. Awakening in separate locked rooms, Jill and Parker manage to regroup and witness a video transmission of a Veltro member threatening to infect one-fifth of the Earth's oceans with the T-Abyss, which was created in retaliation to the FBC for their involvement in the destruction of Veltro's forces on Terragrigia. Jill and Parker reach the ship's antenna to request evacuation but learn that FBC director Morgan Lansdale activated a satellite attack on the Queen Zenobia, which floods the ship with water.  Chris and Jessica arrive at the Queen Zenobia and eventually meet with Jill and Parker. The team is confronted by the Veltro operative, but Jessica shoots him before he reveals details of a larger conspiracy. Parker unmasks him to discover that he was his FBC partner Raymond Vester. He seemingly dies after whispering something to him. Afterward, Chris and Jill make their way to the ship's laboratory to stop the virus from contaminating the sea, while Parker and Jessica search for a way to stop the ship from sinking. As told by Vester, Parker turns his gun on Jessica, suspecting her of being an FBC mole. Jessica wounds Parker and initiates a self-destruct sequence before escaping. Vester reveals himself to be alive and working with O'Brian. Having found the laboratory, Chris and Jill are confronted by Lansdale via a video uplink, revealing that he worked with Veltro in the Terragrigia panic in an effort to increase the FBC's funding and international influence. The pair neutralizes the virus and proceeds to an extraction point.  O'Brian informs Chris and Jill that he had orchestrated the events in an effort to gather evidence of Lansdale's involvement in Terragrigia. He also informs them of the results from Keith and Quint's data analysis: the existence of a sister ship below the ruins of Terragrigia, which was destroyed by Lansdale to eliminate incriminating evidence of his involvement. However, Lansdale then proceeds to arrest O'Brian, cutting off communications. In the sister ship, Jill and Chris search for Veltro leader Jack Norman, knowing that he holds evidence against Lansdale. However, he has gone delusional and survived a year by injecting himself with T-Abyss. After a long battle, Chris and Jill defeat him and broadcast the video, exposing Lansdale. As a result, O'Brian is released, and the FBC is dissolved. In the end, it is revealed that Parker was ultimately saved by Vester. In a post-credits scene, Vester approaches Jessica at a cafe and gives her a sample of the T-Abyss. She asks him why he saved Parker, with him replying that he ""had his reasons.""  "

In December 2014, a new trailer revealed Barry as another playable protagonist and he is joined by Natalia Korda, a little girl with supernatural abilities. The official cinematic trailer was released in December 2014. Resident Evil: Revelations 2 is a survival horror game which supports cooperative gameplay on console platforms. The game has stealth elements as only two of the four playable characters use guns. The other two are more vulnerable, preferring to use weapons such as crowbars and bricks, or be used to find hidden items with a flashlight or special senses.  The game features a Raid Mode, which returns from the first Revelations game with new features, more missions and new playable characters. About 200 missions and 15 characters are featured, which span the entire game series, and there are also new scenarios and enemies from Resident Evil 5, Resident Evil 6 and Resident Evil: Revelations. In this mode, players can customize their skills and weapons, as well as buy new ones. Some enemies in Raid Mode have special abilities like extra speed or strength. This mode can be played either online or through split-screen local co-op.   Claire Redfield and Moira Burton, daughter of Barry Burton, work for biohazard prevention agency TerraSave. While attending an office party, they and several other TerraSave members are captured by armed mercenaries. Claire and Moira are taken to a facility on Sejm Island, where they are attacked by the ""Afflicted"" (humans driven insane by torture and experiments). An unknown woman calling herself the ""Overseer"" watches via cameras and tells them the bracelets on their wrists record fear, as the pair try to find safety. Upon reaching a radio tower, they call for help. Once Barry reaches the island, he immediately meets Natalia, a strange little girl. Together, they head to the radio tower, encountering many dangerous situations along the way. Unfortunately, Barry arrives very late as the distress call was actually made six months ago. After suffering a severe headache, Natalia claims Moira is dead.  Claire and Moira meet up with their co-workers from TerraSave, who have discovered a broken helicopter they intend to fix in order to flee the island. The Overseer explains that they have become her new test subjects for a virus that responds to fear, having previously injected each of them. They soon find themselves ambushed by a horde of Afflicted, separating Claire, Moira, and Pedro from Gabe and the helicopter; Pedro succumbs to fear and is transformed into a monster. Claire and Moira fight off both Pedro and the Afflicted until their boss, Neil Fisher, arrives to help them escape. They decide to make their way to the Overseer's tower but are once again ambushed and Neil stays behind to lure the monsters away. Claire and Moira catch up with Natalia, who has been roaming the island alone, and they befriend her. Gabe fixes the helicopter and attempts to escape, but the Overseer remotely sabotages the controls, killing him. As Claire and Moira are distracted by the crash, Natalia is kidnapped and taken to the Overseer, who intends to transfer her consciousness into the little girl.  Six months later, Natalia takes Barry to the Overseer's tower, the last place she saw Moira alive. Along the way, Barry learns Natalia is an orphan as her parents died in the Terragrigia incident, the trauma having left her immune to fear. Inside the tower, they find a portrait depicting Albert Wesker and a woman; when Barry recognizes him by name, Natalia corrects him by stating the woman is named Wesker. They are then surprised by the Overseer, a grotesque hunchbacked figure who neutralizes Barry and reveals herself to be Alex Wesker.  Claire and Moira follow a note supposedly left by Neil to meet him at a factory nearby. However, they fail to locate him and end up walking into a series of traps, which they narrowly survive. After passing through the sewers, the pair gain access to the Overseer's tower, where they witness a meeting between Neil and Alex Wesker. It is revealed that Neil intends to release Uroboros to justify the FBC, having betrayed TerraSave. Wesker spitefully injects Neil with Uroboros instead, causing him to mutate into a hulking monstrosity. Claire and Moira have no choice but to kill him.   Six months later, Barry and Natalia escape from mutated Alex and work their way from the sewer back to the surface. As they go, Barry tells Natalia about a tragic event concerning his two daughters; Moira accidentally shot her younger sister Polly when they were playing with one of Barry’s guns. Although the fault was his, Barry blamed Moira for the accident, causing a huge strain on their relationship. Polly survived, but Moira developed a fear of guns as a result of the incident. Upon reaching the surface, Barry and Natalia travel through a derelict mine infested with monsters. Alex ambushes them on the other side and throws Barry into a ravine, but when she tries to kill Natalia, the little girl impassively stares back into her eyes, causing Alex to withdraw in terror.  After Neil's demise, Claire and Moira make their way up to the Monument to confront Alex Wesker, and the duo learn of her intentions to conquer fear and escape death. She shoots herself in the head, triggering a self-destruct sequence that forces Claire and Moira to flee. Unbeknownst to them, Alex experiences fear in her last living moments and begins to mutate. As they rush to descend the crumbling tower, Moira sacrifices herself so that Claire can escape; she is rescued shortly afterwards. She regretfully tells Barry that she could not save Moira, but Barry refuses to accept his daughter's death and continues to search for her.   Six months later, Barry and Natalia pass through several toxic mine tunnels before reaching Alex's research facility, disguised as a mansion. They make their way through as Alex taunts Natalia via her bracelet. When the duo confront her, she injects herself with Uroboros and mutates a second time to fight Barry and Natalia. After apparently killing her, Alex suddenly springs to life and incapacitates Barry. She grabs Natalia and once again attempts to kill her. At this point, the story proceeds to one of two endings.  "
881,Retro City Rampage DX,/wiki/Retro_City_Rampage_DX,Action-adventure,Vblank Entertainment,Vblank Entertainment,Unreleased,"August 3, 2017","August 3, 2017"," The game is inspired by Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto games, in that the player can complete a variety of missions within an enormous city that is open to explore. During development, around 50 story missions and 30 challenge levels were planned. elements shared with GTA include the vast assortment of weaponry, the miscellaneous shops, the ability to hijack vehicles, and the ability to attract police attention with violence and destruction.  As a homage to numerous 8-bit video games, Retro City Rampage incorporates design elements from many different genres, and features 16 graphical filters that simulate various retro computers and game consoles. Although it is primarily played from a top-down bird's-eye viewpoint, in specific sections, it may switch to a strictly two-dimensional perspective in the style of a 2D platformer.  The game also includes a ""Free Roaming Mode"" that allows players to freely explore the city and cause as much chaos as they can.  This mode can also be played with unlockable characters from other indie developed games: like Super Meat Boy, Commander Video from the Bit.Trip series, and Steve from Minecraft, among others.  On February 28, the same day as the Wii release, an update for PC became available, allowing users to access a version of the game's prototype, called ROM City Rampage. ROM City Rampage is a port of Retro City Rampage to NES homebrew and emulated within Retro City Rampage. PC users received the update for free, and it was included with the Wii and 3DS versions. The update was later released on PSN and Xbox Live.  "
882,Return of the Obra Dinn,/wiki/Return_of_the_Obra_Dinn,Puzzle,3909,3909,"October 18, 2019","October 18, 2019","October 18, 2019"," The Obra Dinn, insured by the East India Company, went missing in 1803 as it was to sail around the Cape of Good Hope. It has since washed up in port with all sixty passengers and crew dead or missing. The player is tasked to determine the fate of all souls on board, including their names, where and how they met their death, who their killer was, and their location should they be alive.  The game is played in first-person, allowing the player to fully explore the Obra Dinn, using a monochromatic dithering style to mimic the shading & color methods of early computer games. To help track their progress, the player is given a logbook that includes a drawing of all the crew members, the crew roster, and blueprints of the ship. They are also given the ""Memento Mortem"", a pocket watch-like device that can be used on a corpse. When activated, the player will hear the seconds before the death, and can then explore the moment of death frozen in time. This is used to identify who was present, to capture moments in other rooms or on other decks, and to make note of details in the scene. These are used to help connect the faces of crew mates to their names and roles. While exploring a moment of death, the player can use the pocketwatch again to enter more corpses captured in the vision.  With each death, the logbook automatically fills in basic information. The player is tasked only with naming those present & accurately describing their cause of death. Naming the crew is done through small clues, inferences, and logical deduction - mainly, narrowing possibilities as the game progresses. The causes of death are selected out of a catalogue, and some deaths will accept more than one solution. The player can revise their logbook as they gain more information, but to prevent guesswork, ""fates"" are only validated in correct sets of three.   The Obra Dinn, an East Indiaman trade ship, departs from Falmouth to the Orient in 1802 with 51 crewmen and 9 passengers. The ship fails to meet her rendezvous at the Cape of Good Hope, and is declared lost. Five years later, the Obra Dinn reappears off the coast of England with most hands dead. The East India Company sends their Chief Inspector to determine what happened aboard the ship. The inspector has received from Henry Evans - the ship's surgeon, and near-only survivor - the ship's logbook and the ""Memento Mortem"" stopwatch. With these and other clues, the inspector works out the sequence of events after the ship's launch.  The Obra Dinn had launched with a number of passengers, including two royal Formosans and their guards carrying an exquisite treasure chest. Initial calamity struck after launch, with one crew member killed by falling cargo, and two others taken by pneumonia. However, a small group of the crew saw the potential of stealing the Formosan chest, and as they neared the Canary Islands, they abducted the royal Formosans and the chest via rowboat. As they rowed away, three mermaids attacked the boats and killed several of the group. The mermaids' attack was quelled when a Formosan pulled a shell out of the chest, stunning the mermaids, but dying in the process. The remaining crew member returned to the Obra Dinn, along with the captured mermaids and their shells, but he is shot on approach by the surviving Formosan guard. As they were brought aboard, the mermaids attacked and killed more of the crew before they were subdued and locked in the lazarette.  The Obra Dinn circled around to return to England due to the increasing number of deaths. As they started their return, the mermaids caused a terrible storm to strike, and a pair of sea demons mounted on giant spider crabs boarded the ship with the intent of reaching the lazarette to liberate the mermaids, killing 9 more of the crew before being put down. Shortly after dispelling the first assault, the ship was attacked by a kraken, killing 15 more crewmen and the captain's wife. The captain went to the lazarette and threatened to kill all the mermaids in hopes of ending the attack. He executed two before the final one called off the kraken. The shells and the surviving mermaid were then tossed overboard, with the mermaid agreeing to guide the ship back to England. The surviving passengers and some of the crew decided to abandon the Obra Dinn and make for the western coast of Africa. Evans, knowing that the East India Company will investigate the ship via the Memento Mortem, purposefully killed his pet monkey inside the locked lazarette, and kept its paw for safekeeping before leaving with the others. The 3 remaining crewmen turned on the captain, wanting to reclaim the chest and shells as compensation for their hardships, not knowing he had thrown them overboard. The captain killed the mutineers, and then, next to his wife's body, committed suicide.  Several years later, the insurance inspector is able to catalogue all the deaths on the ship, except those within the locked lazarette. After the inspector leaves the ship, a fierce storm rolls in and the Obra Dinn sinks. The completed logbook is mailed back to Evans, and an insurance report is written, compensating the estates of lost crewmen. A year later, the book is mailed back to the inspector along with the monkey's paw, allowing them to use the Memento Mortem to discover what happened in the lazarette and complete the story of the Obra Dinn.

887,Rime,/wiki/Rime_(video_game),Adventure,Tequila Works,Grey Box,"November 16, 2017","November 14, 2017","November 17, 2017"," Rime is played with a third-person view as the player controls a young boy who has washed ashore on an abandoned island. The player can make the boy run, climb, carry objects, and push or pull larger objects across the island's landscapes. The player can have the boy shout or sing, which can trigger certain events tied to nearby statues, such as causing a door to open for a limited length of time.  Through these commands, the player solves various environmental puzzles. Some of the puzzles are based on the use of perspective, using a special turret-like feature to align several disparate objects to create a doorway on a surface they project onto, or trigger other events in a similar way.   Rime begins with a boy washed ashore on a mysterious island, with a giant tower at its center. As the boy explores the island, guided by a magical fox, he encounters a mysterious man in a red cape on several occasions but never reaches him. During the progress of the game, the boy has recollections about how he came to the island. He and his father were at sea when a storm struck and he fell overboard. The boy had tried to save him but could only grab hold of part of the red part of his cloak before the sea took him. The figure in red represents his father, leading him through to the central tower.  As the boy climbs the tower, he comes to additional areas, each individually represents the five stages of grief. Eventually reaching the top of the tower and exploring the area representing acceptance, the boy is forced to let the fox go as it disperses before him. He returns to the central tower and finds that he is now inverted within it, and climbs back through it, eventually reaching the ""top"", the initial island.  At this point, another flashback shows that the story has been actually from the father's perspective; it was his child that had been lost at sea, and the island and tower have been all part of his own mind, coming to grips with his loss. Imagining his child having come back to him, the father goes to the boy's room, examines his various toys, and as he turns to leave, a vision of his child with his red cloth appears on the bed. He hugs his son, the vision vanishing and leaving the red cloth in his hands. The father goes to the window and releases the cloth, finally letting go and accepting the loss of his son.  "
888,Ring Fit Adventure,/wiki/Ring_Fit_Adventure,Adventure,Nintendo EPD,Nintendo,"October 18, 2019","October 18, 2019","October 18, 2019"," Ring Fit Adventure ships with the Ring-Con and Leg Strap, which have docks to hold the Switch's Joy-Con. These accessories are required to play the game, as the player's interactions with them are tracked by the motion controls built into the Joy-Con.  The game's main mode is a role-playing game, in which the player takes the role of a young athlete that meets a sentient Ring, and they team up to take down an evil, bodybuilding dragon named Dragaux. The player moves their character across the game's overworld and into various dungeons, where they encounter monsters to fight. Moving across the game world is similar to a rail shooter; the player moves along a fixed path by running in place, jumps over obstacles by squeezing and releasing the Ring-Con, and can fire projectiles at items by squeezing in the Ring-Con in the target direction. When the player encounters monsters, the game uses turn-based combat as in most role-playing games. The player attacks the enemies by performing one of about thirty different exercises, with the amount of damage they deal based on how effectively they completed the exercise. When the monsters attack, the player can defend by pressing and holding the Ring-Con into their abdomen for as long as possible during the attack. Defeating monsters earns the player-character experience points, and as they level up, they can unlock additional exercises with more potent damage. Exercises are classified by color, each color corresponding to a general part of the body the exercise is geared towards, like shoulders or cardio; monsters are also marked by colors, and exercises of the same color are more effective against them, but only after that specific ability is unlocked early in the game.  In addition to the adventure mode, the game includes a general fitness routine mode that allows one to perform the exercises, assisted by the game, but without the gamification elements. The game also has several mini-games based on certain exercises, which can be used by a single player to challenge themselves or can be used with multiple players each taking a turn to beat the others. An update in late March 2020 also added a ""Rhythm Mode"", which allows the user to move along to soundtrack from the game. This mode also includes some music from other Nintendo games such as Super Mario Odyssey, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Splatoon 2, and Wii Fit.  The game includes the option to enable only quiet exercises to avoid disturbing others nearby. For example, in quiet mode, the running-in-place in the adventure mode is replaced by performing squats.  "
889,Risk of Rain,/wiki/Risk_of_Rain,Action,Hopoo Games,Chucklefish,Unreleased,"September 20, 2018","September 20, 2018"," At the start of the game, the player selects one of twelve characters. Initially, one character is available, the Commando. As the player completes various in-game objectives, more characters become available. Each character has various statistics and a set of unique moves; for example, the sniper has the ability to hit creatures from a long distance for large, piercing damage but their firing rate is slow, while the commando can do rapid, moderate damage at close range.  Within all but the last level of the game, the goal is to locate a teleporter, placed in a random location. As the players hunt for it, they will encounter monsters; upon death, the monsters will drop in-game money and will provide the players experience. As the players gain experience they will increase the player level, gaining more hit points and stronger attacks. Money can be used to open various chests, buy items at stores, activate attack drones that aid in combat, or pray at shrines that have a random chance of dropping items, described by game lore as the space freighter's cargo. There are over 110 items in the game, and these provide benefits such as passive bonuses that improve offensive or defensive capabilities, or a special usable with a cooldown. Players can only hold one usable at any time, but they can collect many passive items, including multiple versions of the same item, stacking the benefits of these items. The location of these items is randomly determined through roguelike procedural generation.  Once the players have found the teleporter, they activate it, starting a 90-second countdown on Drizzle (easy) and Rainstorm (medium) difficulty and a 120-second one on Monsoon (hard) and the players have to survive. During this time, many more monsters, including at least one boss character (if the Kin artifact is not active), will appear. After the countdown is over, no new monsters will appear but the players will have to defeat all remaining monsters before they can use the teleporter and proceed to the next level. At this time, any remaining money the players have is converted to experience points. At the penultimate level, the players have the option of taking the teleporter to the final level (the crashed ship), or to use the teleporter to run through much higher difficulties of previous levels so as to gain more experience and items; when this latter option is taken, the teleporter on these levels will allow the same choice to either proceed to the final level or continue through additional levels. On the final level, the player must fight a final boss character; if they survive, they are able to escape the planet and win the game.  The difficulty of the game is determined by a timer. The difficulty level increases every 5 minutes up through 10 levels, with newly spawned monsters having more health and stronger attacks. Additionally, boss characters may spawn before the players have found teleporters on higher difficulties. If playing alone, the game is over when the player dies. In multiplayer mode, a player that dies must wait until the other players survive to the next level, upon which they are brought back into play.  The item drops are based on the various progress the player has made in the meta-game through repeated playthroughs. For example, defeating certain boss characters for the first time will unlock an item that can then drop in future playthroughs. Other items are based on completing certain goals, such as winning the game a number of times, or performing specific goals with each of the characters. In Rainstorm or Monsoon modes, monsters will also rarely drop log books that describe the monsters; this itself is used to unlock more items and a playable character.  "

On each level the goal is to locate a teleporter, randomly located on the level; once activated, the players must defend themselves from an onslaught of aliens, including bosses until the teleporter is fully active. Killing aliens gains experience and currency; the currency can be used to open chests that randomly drop items on the level. These collectible items offer a wide range of boosts to the players carrying them and provide both synergistic effects and the potential to stack their effects if multiple copies of the same items are acquired. However, the strength, difficulty, and numbers of aliens increase every five minutes, thus making the game harder the longer the players stay on any level. In the metagame, players unlock access to new playable characters, items, and game modifiers by completing certain in-game achievements; once unlocked, new characters or modifiers are available to select from at the start of the game, or the new items can start appearing randomly in-game.  Risk of Rain 2 features several of the same playable characters, creatures, and items from the first game, but transitions the game from 2D to a 3D environment.  "

Each character must try to knock the others out of a 2-dimensional arena. In addition to fighting game-style moves, characters can also use elemental-based attacks or passive abilities that also affect the stage. This creates a meta game of not only attacking other players but also affecting the arena itself.   The game's characters are animal champions from different warring civilizations, who battle to stop a shadowy force from threatening the world. Other characters are also available as downloadable content, beginning on  August 22, 2017 with the release of Ori and Sein from Ori and the Blind Forest. On October 17, 2017, Fornace released two more DLC characters, Ranno and Clairen. Likewise, on April 2, 2018, Fornace released another two DLC characters, Sylvanos and Elliana.

The player can choose between Kyoko or Misako, who play similarly but have unique moves and animations.  Two players can play a local cooperative mode with both.  Waves of enemies and occasional bosses are out to oppose the chosen character(s).  The player progresses through six areas in a linear manner similar to Shodai Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun and Shin Nekketsu Kōha: Kunio-tachi no Banka.  Like River City Ransom, the player is free to return to previous areas, but they must complete certain battles and objectives to go to the new locations in their current area.  In many areas where combat is initiated the first time, chains and a lock will surround the edges of the screen.  At this point, the player will be unable to leave the area until all enemies are defeated.  There are six bosses in the game; to be able to advance to the next area, the player must defeat the boss of the current area.   Defeated enemies drop money for the player to collect, just as in River City Ransom.  Money can be spent at various shops to purchase items, food, and gear to increase stats.  Money can also be used to purchase new fighting moves from the Dojo to complement the starting basic set.  Abilities are all simple to perform, being a direction + a button; complexity for advanced players lies in chaining the simple moves together into long combos.  Characters also gain experience points and level-ups from defeating enemies, as in River City Ransom: Underground.  Completion of quests grant experience and money rewards to both characters, ensuring that the one that the player is not using in a single player game does not fall behind in levels or money. As bosses are defeated in the game, enemies become stronger. Upon defeating the final enemy in an area, they might surrender.  The player can choose to either defeat the enemy as normal, or to recruit them.  Recruited enemies can be summoned to assist the player, although only one recruit is kept at a time.  The player can pick up various objects during the game and use them as improvised weapons, but they will break after being used multiple times.   If the player loses all their stamina bar and is defeated (or both characters defeated in multiplayer), the player must restart the current room and lose a portion of their cash on hand, but their health is fully restored.  In multiplayer, if only one character is knocked out, it is possible for the other player to revive them by standing over their fallen body and repeatedly kicking their departing soul back into it. An angel leaving the character's body acts as a timer so that the other player can perform the revival as fast as possible.    Once introduced, Kunio-kun character Godai will offer players numerous side quests.  There are also various NPCs that the player can interact with.   Misako (voiced by Kayli Mills) is in detention at River City High, accompanied by her best friend Kyoko (Kira Buckland).  She receives an alarming message on her phone: a picture of Kunio (Greg Chun) and Riki (Kaiji Tang), the heroes of River City High and their boyfriends, seemingly being kidnapped. Kyoko and Misako decide to spring into action to rescue their boyfriends.  The pair rampages across the city, attacking any suspicious person they find while attempting to find answers.  "

Its gameplay requires little player interaction as much of the game's duration is spent on reading the text that appears on the screen, which represents the story's narrative and dialogue. The text is accompanied by 3D animated character models, which represent whom Kaito or Akiho is talking to, and background art. Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character models. Robotics;Notes follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.  Throughout the narrative sequences in which the player follows Kaito, the player may activate the PokeCom Trigger (ポケコントリガー, Pokekon Torigā), which replaces Steins;Gate's Phone Trigger system and allows the player to use the applications installed on Kaito's tablet computer.

900,Rocket League,/wiki/Rocket_League,Sports,Psyonix,Psyonix,"November 14, 2017","November 14, 2017","November 14, 2017"," Rocket League's gameplay is largely the same as that of its predecessor, Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. Players control a rocket-powered car and use it to hit a ball that is much larger than the cars towards the other team's goal area to score goals, in a way that resembles a soccer game, with elements reminiscent of a demolition derby. Players' cars have the ability to jump to hit the ball while in mid-air. The players can also pick up a speed boost by passing their cars over marked spaces on the field, enabling them to quickly cross the field, use the added momentum to hit the ball, or ram into another player's car to destroy it; in the latter case, the destroyed car respawns moments later. A player may also use a boost when in the air to propel themselves forward in flight, allowing players to hit the ball in the air. Players can alter their car's orientation while midair, which combined with midair boosting allows for controlled flight. Players can also perform quick dodges, causing their car to do a short jump and spin in a given direction, which can be used to nudge the ball or gain positioning advantage over the other team.  Matches are usually five minutes long, with a sudden death overtime if the game is tied at that point. Matches can be played from between one-on-one up to four-on-four players, as well as in casual and ranked playlists. The latter serves as Rocket League's competitive online mode, where players compete in various tiered ranks within game seasons, with victories or losses raising or lowering a player's rank, respectively. The game includes a single-player ""season"" mode, with the player competing with computer-controlled players. An update in December 2016 introduced ""Custom Training"" sequences that can be created by players and shared with others on the same platform; players are able to specify the ball's path and the presence and skill of opponents on the field as to practice specific shots-on-goal over and over.  A few months after it was released, Psyonix released an update that added game modes known as ""mutators"", modifying some aspects of gameplay, such as increased or decreased gravity, ball size, ball speed and bounciness. For the 2015 holiday season, another update replaced mutator matches with an ice hockey-inspired mode (called ""Snow Day""), played on an ice rink and the ball replaced with a hockey puck with different physics. Positive reception to the ice hockey mode led to it being extended for a few weeks after the holiday season. Snow Day was permanently added to the mutator settings for private matches and exhibition games on February 10, 2016. ""Hoops"", a game mode based on basketball, was added on April 26, 2016. A separate ""Rumble"" mode, which incorporates unusual power-ups, such as the ability to freeze the ball in place or cause a single opponent to have difficulty controlling their car, was added on September 8, 2016. An update in December 2016, known as ""Starbase ARC"" (based on Psyonix' mobile game ARC Squadron) added support for custom arenas for Windows players supported through Steam Workshop, along with other new content.  A new game mode, Dropshot, was added in a March 2017 update. It takes place in an arena without any goals and a field made of hexagonal tiles, and uses a ball that becomes increasingly electrified after successful strikes or passes. The more the ball is struck by players without touching the ground the more electrified it becomes, and the more tiles it damages once it finally does hit the ground. The goal of the mode is to damage the opponent's floor enough to break a hole into it, allowing the ball to drop through and score. Once a team scores, the floor on that side of the field resets to normal (while the floor on the scoring team's side retains any existing damage).  As part of a means to monetize the game beyond downloadable content, Psyonix has tried a few different approaches. In September 2016, it introduced a loot box system known as ""Crates"", where players could purchase them with a random selection of in-game customization items, opened through the purchase of Keys using real-world funds. Due to increasing governmental concern over loot boxes, Psyonix replaced the Crates system with Blueprints in December 2019, which offer a known specific item with potential modifiers as potential end-of-match drops. These Blueprints can then be crafted using the game's premium currency, or purchased with real-world funds, if the player so chooses. Separately, Psyonix added a battle pass feature to the game in September 2018, known as the ""Rocket Pass"". Each pass, which lasts a few months, has challenges and other opportunities through playing Rocket League that allow players to increase the tier of the Pass, from which new unique customization options tied to that pass can be unlocked. While the Rocket Pass is free to all players, a flat-cost premium option can be purchased which accelerates the level up rate and unlocks additional items at certain tier levels. The earlier mentioned ""Snow Day"" was brought back permanently.  "

903,Rogue Legacy,/wiki/Rogue_Legacy,Roguelike,Cellar Door Games,Cellar Door Games,Unreleased,"November 6, 2018","November 6, 2018"," The goal of Rogue Legacy is to explore a randomly generated dungeon, defeat four bosses in each of the four unique environments of the dungeon, and then defeat the final boss. Characters have the default ability to jump and slash with their sword, along with secondary abilities, such as magic attacks, which use mana.  Whenever a character dies as a result of losing all of their Hit Points (HP), control will transfer over to one of three randomly generated heirs which the player may choose between, though this number may be increased to six with a later upgrade. Each descendant carries their unique characteristics and abilities, including such genetic peculiarities as color-blindness (in which the game is presented in black and white), ADHD (in which the player moves faster) and dwarfism (in which the character is short and can fit into small gaps).  Gold found while exploring the castle can be used to improve the character's equipment and abilities, which are passed on to that character's heirs. Gold can be found by smashing pieces of furniture, opening chests, or defeating enemies. There are also various fairy chests hidden in special rooms throughout the castle, most of which require the player to complete an objective, such as taking no damage in the room, in order to be opened.  Spending gold on the manor, which appears after a new heir is chosen, can increase stats, such as health and mana, and unlock and upgrade new classes that may be carried by one of the heirs. These include mages, which can use more advanced spells, warriors, who have higher strength, and assassins, who can use various stealth techniques and have an increased likelihood of having a critical hit.  Gold can unlock the blacksmith, the enchantress and the architect, who each provide their own services. The blacksmith can use blueprints found in the castle to create new armor and equipment for the player, improving their stats. Similarly, the enchantress can use runes found in fairy chests to give the player enhancements, unlocking additional abilities such as double jumping and dashing. Finally, the architect can lock down the design of a previously encountered castle (so that a new one isn't randomly generated) in exchange for a percentage of any gold found.  Any unspent gold must be paid to Charon in order to enter the castle, though upgrades can reduce the amount required to pay.  "
904,Rogue Trooper Redux,/wiki/Rogue_Trooper_Redux,Third-person shooter,Rebellion Developments,Rebellion Developments,Unreleased,"October 17, 2017","October 17, 2017"," The game is a third-person shooter. Rogue's primary arsenal are his pistol and assault rifle, with the latter being upgradeable throughout the course of the game. The rifle may be outfitted with a silencer at any time, or deployed as a sentry turret. As the game progresses the player unlocks the ability to outfit the rifle with a sniper attachment, a shotgun attachment, a cluster mortar attachment, an anti-aircraft rocket launcher, and an electric beam rifle. Other weapons include deployable micro mines, incendiary grenades, scrambler grenades, fragmentation and sticky grenades plus heavy machine gun posts and flak cannons scattered across the field with occasional use of lazooka rocket launchers and hell cannons.  Rogue's survival is ensured through clever use of the battlefield, which is generally rife with cover. He is able to fire while stationary, on the run, crouching, diving, and around the corner of any form of cover. Rogue also has the ability to unleash suppressive fire, which consumes a small amount of ammo and fires blindly from cover to intimidate enemies and cause them to find cover of their own. Enemies are highly susceptible to headshots, which will generally down them in a single strike. Another feature of gunplay is the ability to shoot an enemy soldier's air tank. Targeting the head displays a skull and crossbones, while targeting the gas tank shows a rectangular shape. Penetrating an air tank will cause enemies to run frantically and then explode, damaging any other enemies nearby.  Rogue may search fallen enemy and ally bodies to recover Salvage, the game's main resource, and a necessity for purchasing any of Bagman's supplies. Salvage is used to create all forms of ammunition and grenades, med-kits and arsenal upgrades. Scrap piles may also be found and looted for a considerable amount of Salvage.  "

Some scenarios in the game provide an empty plot of land and allow the player to build a park from scratch, while others provide a ready-built park which usually suffers from deterioration, bad planning, or underdevelopment. The player must wisely invest the limited amount of money provided.  Most scenarios require that the goals be achieved by a specific in-game date, or else the scenario is not 'complete'. Completion of scenarios is a prerequisite for unlocking further scenarios in the first RollerCoaster Tycoon game. In RollerCoaster Tycoon 2, all the scenarios are available for play and the player can complete them in any order they choose.  The player is responsible for building out the park such as modifying terrain, constructing footpaths, adding decorative elements, installing food/drink stalls and other facilities, and building rides and attractions. Many of the rides that can be built are roller coasters or variations on that, such as log flumes, water slides and go-kart tracks. The player can build these out with hills, drops, curves, and other 'special' track pieces (such as loops, corkscrews and helixes), limited only by cost and the geography of the park and other nearby attractions. There are also stationary rides, such as Ferris wheels, merry-go-rounds, and bumper cars, most of which only contain single ride 'piece' and are very limited in terms of variation. Rides are ranked on scales of excitement, intensity, and nausea, all which influence which park guests will ride those attractions and how they will behave afterward. The player can set the prices for park admission rides and guest amenities, although care must be taken so that guests will not think prices are too high. The player is also responsible for hiring park staff to maintain the rides, keep the park clean, enforce security, and entertain guests. Players may also invest in 'research', which unlocks new rides and improvements as time goes on, though it costs money to continue research. Research in a particular category is disabled when all attractions in that category are researched.  The guests, who are integral to the gameplay, are treated as separate entities which can each have particular characteristics and be tracked by the player around the park. The game keeps track of how much money they have, what they are carrying, their thoughts, and what their current needs are (thirst, hunger, etc.). Each guest also has some unique features such as their preferred ride intensity, and their nausea tolerance. Some scenarios are even biased towards a specific guest demographic and require the player to take this into account in designing the park. In RollerCoaster Tycoon 3, the player can create their own guest groups to visit their parks.  Sequels have continually upgraded the number of rides and amount of customization available to the player.  "

The Treasurer, in the throne room, tells the player the fund reserve in his or her castle treasury. Development of new equipment and spells, and establishment of services in Avalon will consume funds. The Treasurer also fills the Emperor with walking about funds if the player needs it. Also in the throne room is the Accountant. He tells the player how much money he or she collects per battle. When the player controls more land on the map, the amount increases. In the southeast corner of the throne room is the Chancellor. He tells the player what problems need to be solved in the world and where to solve them. Solving the problems he points out aids the player to advance to the next generation. The Fighters are the default characters that join the player early in the game. They are not the best characters, but as the player advances through the game, he or she will get other characters who specialize in areas that the Fighters are weak in. The Formation Soldiers demonstrate any battle formations the player happens to know and will collaborate with the player to make new formations. If the heir the player chooses knows a formation, it is recommended that the player consult the Formation Soldiers.   Throughout the game the player will be able to expand the capital.

The gameplay is similar to other console RPGs of the era, but with several notable differences. For example, instead of 'level ups', character stats increase individually depending on their participation in a battle. Also, a character has a certain amount of 'LP', which decreases when the character's HP is reduced below zero or when they are hit while their HP remains at zero. If the LP of a character is zero, they are removed from the party, but they can be recruited again with the exception of the main character of the current game; if the main character reaches zero LP, it results in an automatic game over.  During battle, characters can learn (""spark"") new techniques which often turn the battle in their favor; the same goes for gaining the ability to evade certain enemy attacks. There is also a Commander mode, which requires at least one character more than the lead character, with the lead character on the back lines and out of the battle. If players have less than a full party of six, they may use a smaller formations (i.e. using a four-person formation with a party of five so the main character can direct in Commander mode.) During Commander mode, techniques that involve multiple characters can be learned, depending on the formation.  When choosing to play as Mikhail, the player will start with a mini-war campaign, which continues as the game progresses. Some of these war campaigns must be won or the player loses the game. In these battles, the player controls a band of soldiers instead of individual characters. The player issues commands (forward, quick forward, rush, defend, retreat, morale up, etc.). The point of the battle is to advance to the other side of the map (the player starts on the right and must advance to the left).  "

On starting the game, the player is presented with the first of four puzzle boxes. The first box is offered as a tutorial to the game's controls, which demonstrate how to move around the box and interact with features of the box. The player has a small inventory for items like keys found in compartments in the box. A key inventory element is a special lens that, in-game, allows the player to see things made from the Null element that compose parts of the box. The lens can generally be equipped at any time to see these secrets, often requiring the player to manipulate the view to align secrets into a coherent symbol. The goal is to fully unlock each puzzle box, extracting a smaller but increasingly complex box within it.  "

The player has an energy bar which is depleted by falling too far, crouching under water or being attacked - if the energy bar is completely depleted or if time runs out then it is game over. It can be replenished by standing still and resting if he finds a safe area.  The saboteur can crouch, climb ladders, run and attack enemies by punching and drop-kicking them. He begins with a single shuriken as a weapon and can also utilise improvised weapons (such as bricks and pieces of pipe) found in rubbish piles and boxes around the warehouse. The warehouse contains many security systems the player will need to defeat or avoid. These include guards (who can use hand to hand combat and guns) who stand still and will chase and attack the player if they see him or if he makes too much sound. The guards are assisted by guard dogs and automatic gun emplacements.  Saboteur! also has a difficulty level selection that can be chosen before a game begins.

920,Saints Row The Third,/wiki/Saints_Row_The_Third,Action-adventure,Volition,JP,"May 9, 2019","May 10, 2019","May 10, 2019"," Saints Row: The Third is an action-adventure game played from the third-person perspective in an open world, such that players explore an unrestricted environment. Similar to the premise of the previous Saints Row games, the player's goal is to lead the Third Street Saints gang to overtake its rival gangs in the city turf war. While the protagonist is the same, the game introduces a new setting, the city of Steelport, with its new gangs: the Morningstar, Luchadores, and Deckers, together known as the Syndicate. To further complicate matters, the government's Special Tactical Anti-Gang unit (STAG) is summoned to quell both organizations. The Third is the first in the series to intertwine the narratives of its three-gang structures, and also presents the player with story-altering decisions.   The series has historically been considered a clone of Grand Theft Auto that later positioned itself as more ""gleefully silly"" in comparison. In combat, players select weapons from a weapon selection wheel, including regular pistols, submachine guns, shotguns, and rocket launchers alongside special weapons such as UAV drones and a fart-in-a-jar stun grenade. Player melee attacks include running attacks such as DDTs and a purple dildo bat. Players may use vehicles to navigate the city, including a hover jet (known as the F-69 VTOL) and a pixelated retrogame tank that are unlocked through story missions. Once special vehicles are unlocked, they are in unlimited supply and can be delivered directly to the player-character's location. Player actions are intensified with what Volition calls the ""awesome button"", where for example the player will divekick through the windshield into the driver's seat of a car. The main story campaign missions can be played alone, or cooperatively either online or via System Link offline. Some elements are added to the campaign for the second player. There is no competitive multiplayer, but a ""wave-based survival mode"" called Whored Mode that supports up to two players.  Players customize their characters after the introductory mission. Player-character bodies, dress, and vehicles can be customized, as well as home properties. Players can additionally share their character designs in a Saints Row online community. Apart from the main story missions, there are optional diversions to make money and earn reputation, such as Insurance Fraud, where players hurt themselves in traffic to maximize self-injury before a timer expires, or Mayhem, where players maximize property destruction before a time expires. Some of these diversions were introduced in previous Saints Row games. Activities serve the plot and are positioned as training the player-character or damaging the Syndicate. They can also be repeated. Outside of structured diversions, players are free to make their own fun by purchasing property, shopping for items, finding hidden sex doll and money cache collectibles, and wreaking unsolicited havoc. There are also ""flashpoint"" gang operations that grant respect when disrupted. Attacking others increases the player's notoriety level, as depicted with stars.  Saints Row: The Third introduced experience levels and weapon upgrades to the series. Most actions in the game come with incentives in the form of money and respect (reputation). Money buys land, weapons, and other upgrades, and respect is a kind of experience point that can unlock player abilities like ""no damage from falling"" or ""infinite sprint"", as well as upgrades to the player's computer-controlled gang member support. In turn, players receive further incentive to nearly miss car collisions, streak naked through the streets, shoot others in the groin, blow up Smart cars, and kill mascots in ambient challenges to earn more respect. Lack of respect does not hinder story progress, as it has in previous games. Player progress and unlocks are managed by an in-game cell phone menu that also lets the player call for vehicle deliveries and non-player character backup. The computer-controlled support will also dialogue with each other.   Five years after the events of Saints Row 2, the 3rd Street Saints have evolved into a media and consumer organisation with their own brand. While robbing a bank in Stilwater to promote an upcoming film about themselves, the Boss and their top lieutenants, Shaundi and Johnny Gat, encounter unanticipated resistance on the job, which ultimately leads to them being arrested. The group are turned over to Phillipe Loren, head of an international criminal enterprise known as the ""Syndicate"". After refusing his deal to give the Syndicate most of their profits in exchange for their lives, the Saints stage a breakout, though Gat sacrifices himself to allow the Boss and Shaundi to escape. In response to the incident, Loren orders the Syndicate to attack the Saints, and ensure that their empire is destroyed.  Shaundi and the Boss land in the city of Steelport, firmly ruled over by the Syndicate's three main gangs: the Morningstar, a sophisticated gang led by Loren alongside Viola and Kiki DeWynter, who dominate the sex trade; the Luchadores, a Mexican wrestler-themed gang led by Eddie ""Killbane"" Pryor, who operate their own casino; and the Deckers, a hacker gang led by Matt Miller, who dominate the city's cyber black-market. After Saints lieutenant Pierce Washington arrives with backup, the Saints secure a hideout, and go after Loren's operations, ultimately killing him in his own building. In the process, they rescue Oleg Kirrlov, a former KGB agent being forcefully cloned to provide brutes for the Syndicate, who helps them to track down other allies: ex-FBI agent Kinzie Kensington, who seeks to disrupt the Deckers; veteran pimp Zimos, who lost his business to the Morningstar; and Angel de la Muerte, Killbane's embittered former wrestling partner.  With Loren dead, a power struggle ensues amongst the Syndicate, culminating in Killbane taking over after he kills Kiki in a jealous rage. Out of anger, Viola defects to the Saints and helps them finish off the Morningstar. Meanwhile, the lawlessness in Steelport leads to the federal government approving the initialisation of a taskforce to combat it - the Special Tactical Anti-Gang (S.T.A.G.), led by Senator Monica Hughes and Cyrus Temple. Armed with highly advanced technology, STAG puts the city under martial law until order can be restored. During this time, the Saints focus on the Deckers, with the Boss acquiring items needed by Kinzie to allow him to access the Deckers' network with a virtual avatar. Once inside, the Boss takes on Matt's avatar and defeats it, forcing Matt to retire his gang and leave the city. With only the Luchadores left, Angel suggests humiliating Killbane during his next major wrestling match, resulting in him going on a rampage across Steelport after he loses.  At this point, the Saints find themselves left with a dilemma in dealing with Killbane, after learning that STAG have rigged Steelport's most prominent monument with explosives, intending to destroy it alongside Shaundi and Viola, whom Cyrus had kidnapped and left at the site. Canonically, the player chooses to rescue the gang members, leading to Killbane escaping, though the Saints are hailed as heroes after Cyrus' actions are severely questioned by the federal government. The Saints then proceed to resume their consumer activities, focusing on a new film called ""Gangstas In Space"" that stars the Boss. If the player alternatively chooses to pursue Killbane, they ultimately kill him, but lose their gang members. As revenge, they attack STAG, destroying their floating aircraft carrier and declaring Steelport an independent nation under the rule of the Saints.  "

There are 600 items players may use, and the several weapon categories have special movesets including air attacks. Players can wield two handed weapons for additional power, and shields to defend and parry. Magic and ranged attacks can also be performed. The game implements RPG concepts such as origins, classes and stat development, as well as an extensive skill tree providing hundreds of combinations. The game also provides a multiplayer option, and asynchronous features such as messages that may be interchanged between players. Multiplayer allows for co-operative and versus play, but it is local only.    The game begins with the player stowed away in a ship that is also carrying a princess from an unnamed country who is to be married to an opposing country's king in order to avert war. However, a group of marauders attack the ship, murdering its crew. If the player kills all the marauders and escapes to the deck, they are then set upon by a giant ""Kraekan"" (a corruption of kraken) of the sea resembling Cthulhu. Whether or not they are able to defeat the marauders and the powerful kraeken, the ship is wrecked, sending them drifting to shore on a mysterious island.  There, the player meets a strange old man who gives them an icon of one of three creeds the player says they are a member of, helping them in their quest to find the lost princess. The player places this icon in the first Sanctuary and then continues exploring the island, gathering salt in order to gain power, as in this universe, humans are known as Saltborn and are ostensibly largely composed of it. There, it is possible to meet several NPC's with side-stories, an unnamed Knight, Thief, and Sorcerer. The player also meets a highly sinister talking Scarecrow that threatens that they will perish.  In the process of conversing with these NPCs throughout the journey, they come to realize that the island is made up of copies of dangerous locations from the various continents of the world, and that some kind of power ""collected"" them. The player realizes that the Scarecrow is the avatar of a being known as the Nameless God, and also that the princess they were searching for may not have even been royalty, but rather a slave that was to be sacrificed to the Nameless God in exchange for ending the current war, as has been done many times in the past. An optional boss fight also reveals that the Nameless God has killed the current gods of the world, known as the Three, by trapping them in special coffins and receiving and answering prayers meant for them, as gods require worship to survive.  Finally, the main character meets the old man for the final time, and he reveals that he was once Jaret, a great king who once ruled the island and agreed to be the servant of the Nameless God in exchange for power. The Nameless God is an incredibly powerful being who is Saltborn (i.e. mortal), but desires to be a divine being, yet is unable to no matter how much power he collects due to him not having a soul of fire like other gods.  The player travels to the Nameless God's castle and defeats him, finding a well with which they are able to escape from the island and presumably end the cycle of war that the Nameless God perpetuated. Alternatively, they can choose to pick up the Nameless God's helmet and gain his full power, but be trapped on the island.  "

The plot of each game is quite different, but they circle a central group of characters and a region in Japan.  Samurai Shodown consequently portrays snippets of the Japanese culture and language internationally with little edits. For instance, unlike most fighting games made in Japan, the characters in the series (including the announcer) generally speak only in Japanese, with dialects ranging from archaic formalities and theatricalism to modern-day slang, something that has been preserved for overseas releases. Win quotes and other cut scenes provide subtitles in several languages, including but not limited to English, Portuguese, and German. Much of the music includes traditional Japanese instruments (predominately the shakuhachi, shamisen, koto and taiko) and later enka. Several characters are loosely based on real figures from Japanese history.  Games  "

In the game, players control the main character, Marty, and navigate an open world occasionally triggering battles with enemies. Battles in the game deviate from the standard Japanese role-playing game systems by giving the player some degree of active control during battles. Some attacks require additional inputs to power up and all enemy attacks can be blocked with a well-timed button press. While not in battle, players can discover new items to use in fights, partake in a number of side quests, and earn experience by exploring the environments. Players can also discover power enhancing Scratch and sniff stickers in the world that can be attached to their notebook. These stickers must be scratched at the beginning of battle to unleash their effects.  Saturday Morning RPG's story is structured in an episodic fashion, much like the Saturday-morning cartoons it draws inspiration from. Episodes can be played and replayed in any order, and any player stats or items earned can be transferred between episodes. There are currently five episodes of Saturday Morning RPG.  "

In each level, the player controls the main character as they automatically travel through a surrealistic landscape alongside a pop music soundtrack. The general mechanics of each level change, but in general the player attempts to guide the character to collect hearts across the level to each points, while avoiding obstacles. In some levels, the player will be prompted to press a button in time with the soundtrack to make a jump or avoid an obstacle. Other levels may require the player to move a cursor on screen to target a bow-and-arrow weapon to defeat enemies, in a manner similar to Rez. During the levels, the player will encounter different boss encounters, which will incorporate a mix of movement and timed button presses to avoid attacks. The player earns points for hearts collected, timing on button presses, and avoiding obstacles, and are rated on a bronze, silver, or gold rating for each. Should the player hit an obstacle or enemy projectile, they are returned to a checkpoint. If the player fails to clear a section after a few tries, the game provides a means for the player to skip that section, only losing out on possible points that could be earned.   In an alternate universe watched over by three divine arcana of the Tarot (The High Priestess, The Hierophant, and The Empress), a cursed arcana named Little Death (Death), and her allies, the Dancing Devils (The Devil), the Howling Moons (The Moon), the Stereo Lovers (The Lovers), and Hermit64 (The Hermit), stole all harmony, and hid it in their hearts. Before the divine arcana began to fade, they created a heroine from the shards of a broken heart.  In a time near the present, there is a young woman whose heart has been violently broken. The heroine the divine arcana created transforms into a butterfly and flies to the young woman, who is resting in bed. The butterfly transports her to the alternate universe. Riding her longboard along an ethereal highway, she chases the butterfly, and upon capturing it, she transforms into a masked heroine (The Fool).  She then falls through a passage and arrives in a purple and pink city. She summons a motorcycle, and begins to ride through it. Weaving through cars, trams and buildings, she meets a trio of masked women, the Dancing Devils. They fight on the street, before riding through the city on motorcycles. The heroine chases and defeats each member of the trio in turn, and takes back their hearts. The heroine then travels to a mythical forest. With the help of a stag, she rides through the forest and meets the Howling Moons, a quartet of masked women. After she chases them the quartet transform into a pack of wolves, and the heroine equips her motorbike with dual automatic guns. The masked quartet jump into a large mechanical cerberus and a battle ensures, but the heroine destroys their mech, and claims the quartet's hearts.  The heroine is then transported to a tower, and upon climbing it, is transported to a floating city. She meets and fights a masked foe with a sword, who splits into two women, the Stereo Lovers. The foes then switch up the universe they are in every couple of seconds, but the heroine learns to do the same, and chases the duo through the city. She defeats them on top of a plane and claims their heart, before travelling to a desert. Driving a car through the night, she meets Hermit64, a foe wearing a virtual reality headset as a mask. The heroine travels into the hermit's virtual reality world, and obtains the heart trapped inside. Sailing across an ocean, she then arrives in a dark and rainy city.  There she meets a masked foe with a scythe, Little Death. The foe sends flying skulls after the heroine, but she summons a bow and shoots them down. She then defeats Little Death, but the foe's heart fragments reassemble into a gigantic final monster. After defeating it, the heroine transforms back into her former self, the young woman. She then imagines herself as each of her former foes, and proceeds to fight each in turn. Instead of defeating them however, she forgives them with a brief kiss. The divine arcana then tell the young woman that she has restored harmony to their world, and wish her farewell. She rides back to her world on her skateboard and arrives slightly older, but right back into her groove.  "

The player controls a character named Maxwell, who must collect objects called ""Starites"" to complete each level. Maxwell is guided by tapping the touchscreen, or if the player taps an object, Maxwell will pick it up or be given other options for interacting with that object, such as riding a horse or bicycle or shooting at an object if he holds a weapon. A fundamental element of Scribblenauts is the ability of the player to summon myriad objects into the game. This is achieved by writing the name of an object on the touchscreen. For example, the player can write ""ladder"", summoning a ladder, which the player may use to climb to an out-of-reach Starite. The player may turn the ladder on its side and set it on fire. The player may also chain objects together, such as chaining a piece of meat to a pole and holding it while riding on a raptor.  Summoned objects range among animals, weapons, forces of nature, famous people (both fictional and real), vehicles, household objects, easter eggs of the development team, and even internet memes. However, the game does not include trademarked terms, nor potential profanity (summoning ""ass"" will spawn a donkey; summoning ""cock"" will spawn a rooster). The game includes a homonym system to offer the player possible choices between similar-sounding objects, such as distinguishing between a toy balloon and a hot-air balloon; there is also a spellchecker to provide close matches for misspelled words. The North American release includes support for other languages including Brazilian Portuguese, French, and Spanish, with French-Canadian and Latin American variants available for words in the French and Spanish language sets, respectively. The UK version also accounts for difference between American and British English, such as the differing meanings of the word ""football"".  5th Cell has stated that the limit to what objects may be summoned is up to the player's imagination. Players, using special software, claimed to have discovered that the full list of words is greater than 22,800 unique entries, but, in response, Slaczka said there were many more than this number.  The game is segmented into 220 levels over 10 themed areas, and each given a 4 star ranking based on its difficulty, with later areas featuring more high ranked levels. Puzzles are given a par for the number of objects they can summon, typically being between two and four, though the player is free to summon more, so long as there is space in the meter at the top screen (summoning the same number of objects as the par or less earns more points). There are two types of levels—puzzle and action levels. Puzzle levels are real-life situations (such as having to open a piñata) where the Starite is awarded once the puzzle is solved, while action levels will appeal to gamers that prefer side-scrolling platformers, featuring switches, spike traps, and other similar elements. Players are awarded ""merits"" for completing levels while meeting certain requirements, such as not summoning any weapon-like object. Once the player completes a level, a silver star appears on the level selection button and a ""Free play"" mode is unlocked. At that point, the player is given the option to play through the level three consecutive times without reusing objects. Successfully completing the challenge grants the player a gold star for that level. Scribblenauts presents a simplistic storyline, as the developers wished to focus on engaging gameplay. The game always rewards the player with ""Ollars"", its in-game money, to allow them to purchase new areas, different avatars and other visual changes to the game.  The game includes a level editor, allowing users to share these levels over the Nintendo Wi-Fi system. The player can start with any level that they have already beaten from the main game, and add new objects with new game properties.  These new properties can vary significantly from the normal behavior, such as having a bear able to eat a plane.  "

Lafcadio Boone, a preacher, wakes up during the yearly party, called The Sexy Brutale, that Lucas Bondes hosts in his casino mansion. A mysterious woman, called the Bloody Girl, has given Boone a mask that has ripped him out of an ongoing time loop that the rest of the other party members are stuck in over a 12-hour period, reliving their deaths over and over again. She has also given Boone a broken watch, that when the timer reaches the hour of 5, the day resets. Boone's task is to save the other party goers from their gruesome deaths before they happen by learning different ways over the 12 hour period by discovering clues, recipes, or items. The first man he saves, Sixpence, takes the watch and fixes it so that the full 12 hours of the day become available. Boone then sets out to prevent the other deaths.  Upon saving these other party goers, they remove their masks, talk to Boone to show they know him in some way. Boone then takes each mask, absorbing the powers they hold and giving him the means to save the other members and advance in the mansion.  After several party-goers have been saved, The Gold Skull, a man in a golden skull mask seemingly content on letting the actions play out, reveals himself as the instigator of the time loop. He reveals that the deaths that Boone has been preventing over the course of the 12 hour time loop, were created by the Gold Skull as a means to punish Boone.

A man named Legion appears and tells Jack that the power he seeks does exist and offers to share this power with him if Jack constructs an insane asylum for like-minded killers in Deadside – the land of the dead. Proclaiming ""for we are many!"", Jack commits suicide.  In the present day, Michael LeRoi becomes the current Shadow Man – a lineage of voodoo warriors who protect the world of the living (known as Liveside) from threats crossing over from Deadside – after the voodoo priestess Mama Nettie bonds the Mask of Shadows to him. Nettie has a prophetic dream that Legion is preparing to usher in the Apocalypse by claiming the Dark Souls – the immortal souls of damned warriors – and using them to create an immortal army and send it into Liveside. Nettie reveals that Michael cannot stop the Five, a group of serial killers recruited by Legion, without his powers. The Five, who each have a Dark Soul within them, are hiding in Liveside, where Michael's powers do not work during the day. Michael travels to Deadside with the use of his dead brother's teddy bear, which serves as a link between both worlds.  After collecting all of the Dark Souls in Deadside and passing trials set by the gods of Deadside, Michael assembles a magic knife called the Eclipser.

Michael finds his long-dead brother Luke within the Dark Engine along with several paths to Liveside which lead to the hiding places of the Five.

Michael returns to Deadside and shuts down the Engine, giving Luke his teddy bear back. Luke reveals himself to be Legion in disguise.  Legion reveals that he sent Nettie the dream so that Michael would be forced to collect all of the Dark Souls and confront Legion, enabling Legion to claim all of the souls at once and use them to power the Engine, creating his army and sending it into Liveside.

Due to the castle's perilous nature, at least one lit torch must be in the player's possession at all times. If the torch is extinguished, the player soon stumbles, breaking his neck, and must then continue from a saved game (or the area in which they died, in game console versions). Only a finite number of torches are to be found throughout the game, which effectively acts as a time limit to proceedings. Various items that can be acquired include a sword, a sling and other ancient weapons; though these weapons can not actually be used as striking weapons, they can be clicked on at the appropriate time to deliver a fatal blow to specific enemies.  The game is notorious for its many opportunities for death, including being burned by a dragon's breath, attacked by a cyclops, sucked into outer space through a broken mirror, dissolved by acidic slime, mauled by a wolf-woman, eaten by sharks, and suicide. Virtually any action taken by the player which is not the correct solution to a puzzle will result in a fatality. These deaths were often graphically described in the game's text (along with often sardonic and humorous comments), even in the NES version (in spite of Nintendo's policy of censorship at the time). Many of the game's puzzles rely on a system of trial and error, the problem of which is overcome by the ability to save the game state (as in most adventure games). Subtle hints can be found in books and the descriptive game texts. In the NES version, these are replaced by an outright hint feature which gives vague clues about what is noteworthy in any given room in the castle. The further the player progresses, however, the more useless this feature becomes, deteriorating into nothing but encouraging messages by the game's end.

Reading the book Before Shadowgate, the comic book Shadowgate Saga: Raven, and playing the sequels Beyond Shadowgate and Shadowgate 64: Trials of the Four Towers reveals more details.  "

The game features five towns, with various areas filled with enemies and obstacles in between them.

In place of transformation dances, Shantae can use a genie lamp to suck up nearby gems, as well as carry dark magic and other gaseous objects like smells.  Unlike the fully interconnected world of its predecessors, the world of Pirate's Curse is spread across multiple islands that Shantae can travel to via Risky Boots' pirate ship. These islands each require Shantae to gain access to a Den of Evil, where one of the pirate items can be found, and defeat a boss in order to gain a map to the next island. Players will often be required to fulfill certain quests in order to progress, such as finding an item on one island and giving it to someone on another. Hidden across the various islands are twenty cursed Cacklebats, which the player must defeat and extract Dark Magic from in order to obtain the game's best ending. Up to 32 Heart Squids can also be collected, which can be exchanged to increase Shantae's maximum health.

As Shantae rushes out to investigate, her friends Sky and Bolo tell her that their hometown of Scuttle Town is being taken over by the Ammo Baron, who, after a brief scuffle, reveals that he bought the town from Mayor Scuttlebutt and is legally now its new mayor. Ammo Baron places Shantae under lockdown pending further punishment. Defeated and despondent, Shantae returns home, where she is confronted by her nemesis, the pirate Risky Boots. Risky accuses Shantae of robbing her, as her henchmen and items have suddenly gone missing. The two discover that Dark Magic has overtaken Risky's Tinkerbats, turning them into evil Cacklebats. Risky deduces that the Pirate Master, a powerful evil tyrant and her former captain who was sealed away long ago by Sequin Land's genies, is trying to use the Dark Magic to revive himself. Determined to stop his revival at all costs, Risky forms a reluctant alliance with Shantae to destroy the dens of evil giving him power, recover Risky's lost pirate items, and retrieve the Dark Magic inhabiting the Cacklebats. Along the way, Risky reveals that the Dark Magic is actually Shantae's genie magic, which was corrupted and scattered across Sequin Land rather than destroyed.  After Shantae destroys all of the evil dens, Risky attempts to destroy the Pirate Master's grave, but is kidnapped by the revived Pirate Master. Shantae gives chase back to Scuttle Town, and confronts the Pirate Master in the Sequin Land palace. Shantae agrees to give up the Dark Magic she had collected in order to save Risky. To her surprise, she discovers that the magic has turned back into Light Magic, allowing Shantae to once again become a half-genie and defeat the Pirate Master with Risky's help, releasing his curse from Risky's Tinkerbats and weapons. With peace returned to Sequin Land, Shantae and Risky develop a mutual respect and understanding of one another, though Risky admits that she will never be one of the good guys. Later, Shantae uses her powers to return Scuttle Town's ownership and drive the Ammo Baron out of town, while Risky returns to her life of piracy, preparing for when their paths cross again.  If Shantae does not collect all the Dark Magic, an alternate ending occurs where the Pirate Master escapes and Risky retakes her equipment from Shantae, revealing the items' curse which will eventually overtake her. Risky leaves to confront the Pirate Master alone, while Shantae vows to retrieve all of her missing magic.  "

These are used to affect outcomes in dangerous situations, such as when being attacked by a spirit, in a system called Suspensive Act.   Shibito Magire is set in a suburb of H City in Tokyo, and revolves around Konoehara Academy, where gruesome events occur every ten years. The police are unable to explain the incidents, and classify them as accidents, but they are rumored to be caused by spirits. Because of this, Konoehara's principal hires Kazuo Yashiki of the Kujo family to infiltrate the school as a teacher and investigate the incidents.  "

958,Shironeko New Project,/wiki/Shironeko_New_Project,Action role-playing,Colopl,Colopl,TBA,Unreleased,Unreleased," A long time ago, there is an ancient legend revolving around two figures, the White Maiden of the Sky; represented by the White Cat, and the Black Prince of Darkness; represented by the Black Cat. At the same time, a war between the demons and the guardians of light took place, with the demons led by the Black King of Darkness attacking the lands in the sky. The Black Prince however, despite the wishes of the Black King, defied his orders and falls in love with the White Maiden, in hopes that their union would end the war. Both were not meant to meet and love each other as the war ravaged the world around the land and the skies.  Several millennia after the war, in a world consisting of numerous isles, a young hero from the Astora Isle encounters the adventurer Kyle and follows him on an expedition on the isle. They meet a mysterious girl named Iris and a talking white cat named Catra, and together they make their way to the isle's ruins, where they find a flying island. Kyle becomes consumed by darkness there, and the party resolves to travel to the ends of the world on the flying island in order to find the seven ""Great Runes"", following Kyle's words before he disappeared. Upon their adventures towards finding the Runes, both the hero and Iris start to fill the pieces, meeting friends and enemies and discovering their true identities.   White Cat Project is an action role-playing game with touchscreen controls, where the player controls the character by dragging the finger across the screen (a mechanic Colopl calls ""Punicon"") and tapping to attack. Special abilities can be activated by holding the finger on the character, which opens up a selection menu of abilities. All of these actions can be done using one finger only, which facilitates one-handed gaming.  The characters also have their own classes corresponding to weapon types, for example swords, bows, and mage staffs. In general, most characters are gained via a ""Summon"" tab which works on a gacha system. Runes are spent on randomized characters, with some characters being common and other characters being rare.  Some characters can be gained for free by completing in-game missions. While the game is fully playable as a single-player experience, it also supports up to four-player co-operative multiplayer. There is also a town-building mode where players can build and upgrade structures that generate in-game currencies and provide combat bonuses to their characters. Unlike many free-to-play games, White Cat Project has no stamina system.  "

The player controls an airplane along two axes while attacking enemies. The gameplay world is rendered in 3D, and at key points an in-game cutscene plays in which the camera and plane move. These are often transitions into another part of the gameplay world, but are also used to give the player a new perspective for things such as boss battles. The plane's primary weapons can be upgraded, and players are equipped with a limited-use, more powerful secondary weapon to eliminate more on-screen enemies at one time. Consecutive kills with the primary weapon will increase the game's score multiplier, while use of the secondary weapon or time manipulation will reset the multiplier. The player's final score is determined by a number of factors including kills, damage taken, and powerups collected.  As the game is marketed as a bullet hell shooter it features four difficulties: normal, challenging, hard and insane. The normal difficulty reduces the on-screen ordnance from enemies, while the insane difficulty is geared towards those who are veterans of the genre. In this difficulty the ordnance on the screen is much higher, forcing a greater difficulty level. In addition, four game modes are included: Story, Arcade, Score Attack, and Boss Training. Story mode is the primary mode of the game and allows the player to see the narrative as the game progresses. On the standard difficulty players are given eight continues, while the Insane difficulty yields only five. Completing levels on the more challenging difficulty unlocks an alternate narrative. Arcade mode removes the narrative cutscenes and limits the player to only three continues. Score Attack mode allows players to replay any stage previously completed with only one life. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible and complete the stage. Players do not progress to the next stage after completion in this mode. Boss Training allows players to practice and/or replay any unlocked boss battles. Continues in this mode are unlimited.  Sine Mora does not use a traditional player health mechanic. It instead plays on the aspect of time. Each level is given a set amount of time which continues to tick downwards. Taking damage will temporarily speed up this process, while eliminating enemies will add time back. Powerups in the game can provide bonuses such as shielding, extra time, and upgraded weapon. Players can choose from multiple characters and planes, and the combination of choices determines the vital statistics during play. Characters are not tied to a specific plane, rather characters and planes each have unique attributes, the combination of which determines the statistics.  "
962,The Sinking City,/wiki/The_Sinking_City,Action-adventure,Frogwares,Bigben Interactive,"September 12, 2019","September 12, 2019","September 12, 2019"," The Sinking City is an open-world detective game with a third-person camera perspective. It features an investigation system in which the outcome of the player's quests will often be defined by how observant the players are when investigating different clues and pieces of evidence.  The town of Oakmont is made up of seven districts (Advent, Coverside, Grimhaven Bay, Oldgrove, Reed Heights, Salvation Harbor, and The Shells) which have all been affected by flooding to various degrees, and the player must use a boat to safely traverse the flooded streets to reach drier areas. The player can swim if necessary, but the water is infested and can fatally damage the player's health and sanity. The player also assembles an arsenal of tools and weapons, and at times must use them to kill otherworldly creatures and dispel hallucinations. However, as Oakmont is an isolated place with dwindling resources and deteriorating social order, bullets have replaced money as the preferred currency; expending too many bullets can leave the player unable to barter for desired items. Another major resource is sanity, which is spent on investigative powers used to reconstruct crime scenes and identify clues. Sanity slowly regenerates on its own, but can be replenished faster with antipsychotic drugs. Disturbing scenes and encounters can cause sudden, sharp drops in sanity, affecting the player's perception of the surrounding environment, and complete loss of sanity is fatal.   The Sinking City takes place in the secluded fishing town of Oakmont, Massachusetts in the 1920s, a place that is not marked on any map and few people know how to find due to its remoteness. Oakmont has a long history of association with the occult, and many of its citizens are not only eccentric, but unabashed practitioners of occultism. Cultists in bloody ritual garb are an unremarkable sight on the streets alongside fishermen, average townsfolk, refugees from the destruction of nearby Innsmouth, the destitute and desperate, and well-heeled members of the upper class. The town also developed its own unique dialect over the years, but the origin of many phrases is murky. Six months ago, Oakmont was inundated by a mysterious, persistent flood of supernatural origin that has submerged many of its streets and cut it off from the mainland. ""The Flood"", as it is known by Oakmonters, brought with it a dark force that inexorably instills hysteria and madness in the minds of the terrified citizens, and the struggling town is on the brink of collapse. In addition, droves of people from outside Oakmont who were reported missing have been turning up in the town, drawn by haunting, unaccountable visions.  Charles Winfield Reed, a U.S. Navy sailor and World War I veteran turned private investigator, travels from Boston to Oakmont at the invitation of intellectual Johannes van der Berg to discover the cause of the nightmarish visions that have been plaguing him since the disappearance of the ship he served on, the USS Cyclops. These visions are shared by numerous other people and are reported most frequently in Oakmont. Reed is also hired by Robert Throgmorton, the influential and physically striking head of one of Oakmont's leading families who has also been studying the visions, to help uncover the cause of the Flood plaguing the town. While Reed pursues this investigation and others using extrasensory powers of observation seemingly bestowed by his visions, uncovering the shadowy history and seedy underbelly of Oakmont along the way, he must guard his sanity as it is eroded by the town's darkness, otherworldly creatures attracted to death called Wylebeasts, and the use of his own powers.  Reed's search for answers ultimately unearths a plot by the Great Old Ones to purge humanity. Johannes van der Berg is revealed to be a guise used by Hastur, the King in Yellow, who lures potential Chosen to Oakmont in order to unseal the sunken temple of Cthygonnaar, which imprisons Cthylla, the secret daughter of Cthulhu and Idh-yaa as well as the source of the Flood, Wylebeasts, and the nightmares. Once Cthylla is freed, she will give birth to Cthulhu's reincarnation, resulting in Oakmont drowning in the sea and the world being destroyed by the arrival of the other Great Old Ones. Reed is faced with a choice, leading to one of three endings. He can escape Oakmont and return to Boston with the artifact used to awaken Cthylla in an attempt to prevent the apocalypse from ever coming to pass, commit suicide to leave his destiny as the Chosen unfulfilled and thus delay Cthylla's awakening for a few more centuries, or accept his destiny and unleash Cthylla, who then consumes him and ascends to the surface. It is implied that the fruition of Cthulhu's plan is inevitable even in the former two endings, as Reed is seen either witnessing or hallucinating Johannes arriving in Boston and flooding it, or Johannes is seen on the Oakmont docks awaiting another boat with another prospective Chosen.

964,Skullgirls 2nd Encore,/wiki/Skullgirls_2nd_Encore,Fighting,Reverge Labs,Marvelous,"October 22, 2019","October 22, 2019","October 22, 2019"," The engine and playstyle for Skullgirls were intentionally modeled after Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, incorporating several similar game mechanics such as tag team-based combat, character assists, snapbacks, and delayed hyper combos. The game can be played using different ratios of characters (similarly to Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001), with each player able to select up to three fighters on their team. The teams are then balanced based on the number of team members. A single character possesses more health and deals more damage, while larger teams gain the ability to perform character assists and recover health when tagged out. Players can also customize their character assist attacks.  The game includes a story mode, arcade mode, versus mode, training room, tutorial mode, and online play using the GGPO networking library. Skullgirls includes various unique features to address system and balance problems, such as infinite combo detection. When the game detects a looping combo through monitoring the players' attacks, the other player can break free of the infinite by hitting any button. In addition, Skullgirls offers protection against ""unblockable attacks"", which occur when a player, for example, uses a low-hitting move and a high-hitting assist attack at the same time, making it nearly impossible for the opponent to block. The game attempts to remedy the issue by offering a brief period of unblockable protection after successfully blocking any attack.  At release, Skullgirls Encore saw  numerous gameplay adjustments and additions, including character balance tweaks, faster gameplay, an online training mode, and a stun meter designed to limit lengthy combos without compromising creativity. A new local game mode called ""Typing of the Skullgirls"", a mode inspired by games like The Typing of the Dead, was also added. When enabled, teams automatically generate meter and all attacks deal negligible damage. Super moves give typing prompts to the player, awarding damage for typing accuracy. In addition to fully voiced story modes and cross-platform play across the entire PlayStation family, Skullgirls 2nd Encore introduced challenges, where players fight against opponents under unique battle conditions; trials, which test players' skills by having them perform combos; and survival mode, which pits players against endless waves of enemies. The mobile version of Skullgirls incorporates RPG-like progression, customization, and deck-building mechanics.  "
967,Skylanders Imaginators,/wiki/Skylanders_Imaginators,Action-adventure,Toys for Bob,Activision,Unreleased,"March 3, 2017","March 3, 2017"," In the past, the ancients used powerful Mind Magic to conjure and create anything they could think of. However, one of the Ancients, known as Brain, tried to use Mind Magic to brainwash all of Skylands, so the ancients sealed him away, and sealed away the power of Mind Magic so evil could not use it.  Following the events of the last game, there has been an era of peace. However, a mysterious being soon steals a book from the Skylanders Academy, and is soon revealed to work for Kaos, who seeks to use the power of Mind Magic to create an army of Doomlanders to conquer Skylands. However, his constructs prove feeble and erratic, leading him to seek the aid of Brain, the last remaining Ancient. With this, he becomes more capable, but still remains unable to defeat the player, so they instead decide to brainwash all of Skylands and protect their fortress with an impenetrable force field, leaving only Spyro immune because of his dragon body. They are able to free the Skylands from the brainwash, and trick Kaos into letting them in. In the final battle, Kaos powers into a more powerful form summoning various Doomlanders to aid him but Brain, frustrated at Kaos' low intelligence and insults, betrays him and fights alongside the player. When Kaos is defeated, Brain tries to run, but works alongside the Skylanders under the threat of being sealed away, and shrinks Kaos and Glumshanks, with the game ending before he starts to tell a tale.   Similar to its predecessors, the core gameplay revolves around solving puzzles, platforming, and fighting enemies. As the title is a toys-to-life game, players can put Skylanders toy figurine onto a Portal of Power, which will then allow players to control the figurine-represented character in-game. Creation Clash, a remake of Skystones which was introduced in Giants is featured in the game. The game supports local multiplayer.  One of the newest additions are ""Imaginators"", which are characters created by the player. At the beginning of the game, players can select a battle class (Knight, Smasher, Sentinel, Swashbuckler, Brawler, Sorcerer, Quickshot, Ninja, Bazooker, and Bowslinger) and elemental class (The ten elements of the Skylanders series), which determines their fighting style. Afterwards, players can customize the names, voices, fighting abilities, appearances, colors and sizes of their Imaginators. For players who do not wish to create a new character, they can use a mechanic that automatically generates an Imaginators randomly, or use any existing Skylanders featured in its predecessors. The Imaginators created can be shared to other players. Body parts, which are classified into four types, namely Common, Rare, Epic, and Ultimate, can be found when players are exploring in the game. These new parts can be used to customize the player's existing Imaginators, which can be modified at any time. Creation Crystals are where the Imaginators are stored. With the crystal, players can transport their custom Imaginatiors to all video game consoles the game is released for. In addition to Imaginators, the game also adds 31 more typical Skylanders into the game. These new characters are called ""Senseis"", and they are extremely powerful, as they are extremely refined in their respective classes. 11 of these Senseis are villains who had appeared in previous Skylanders games. They also have the ability to perform a special attack called ""Sky Chi"". These Senseis lead the Imaginators, and involve in helping them to unlock their abilities, techniques, weapons, and level-cap. Senseis are optional, and players can complete the game without using them.  Both Crash Bandicoot and Doctor Neo Cortex appear as guest characters with their own level, Thumpin' Wumpa Islands. This level has iconic gameplay features present in previous Crash Bandicoot games.  "
969,Slay the Spire,/wiki/Slay_the_Spire,Roguelike,MegaCrit,Humble Bundle,"June 6, 2019","June 6, 2019","June 6, 2019"," Slay the Spire is a combination of roguelike-like gameplay with a deck-building card game. At the start of a playthrough the player selects one of four predetermined characters, which sets a starting amount of health, gold, a starting relic that provides a unique ability for that character, and an initial deck of cards with basic attack and defense cards as well what potential color-coded cards tailored to that character they will see through the run. The goal is to work through several levels of a spire, each level having a number of potential encounters distributed in a branching structure with a boss character at the end of the level. Encounters include monsters, campfires to heal or upgrade cards to more powerful versions, shopkeepers to buy cards, relics and potions as well as to remove cards from the deck, chests with random loot, and random choice-based encounters.  Combat is played in turns. Each turn the player receives a fresh hand of cards and three energy points. The player can play any combination of cards as long as they have the energy to pay for the energy cost of each card, and at the end of the turn, all cards not played are sent to a discard pile. Players' cards vary by the character but generally consist of attack cards to damage opponents, skill cards that buff themselves, debuff opponents, or add to their blocking power for the turn, and power cards where the effect remains in play until the end of combat. Each opponent on the field will telegraph what move they will make: if they will attack and with how much damage, if they will block, cast a spell to buff themselves or debuff the player. In some cases, the opponents' attack or the player cards may add unplayable cards representing battle conditions like Wounds and Curses to the player's deck that can dilute a player's hand and may add negative effects while in the player's hand. The player can determine the best strategy to avoid taking any damage after they complete their turn. If the player's health drops to zero, the game is over and they must restart from the bottom of the spire. Otherwise, if the player defeats all the monsters in an encounter, they typically receive gold and a choice of one of three randomly-selected cards to add to their deck, if desired. Other loot that can be obtained from monsters or other encounters include relics that provide a permanent character buff for the duration of the game, such as increased maximum health, additional energy points, lower casting costs, and automatic blocking, and single-use potions that can be used during any turn for no cost to restore health, buff the player, and debuff or damage the enemy.  The deck-building game requires players to develop a strategy for their deck on the fly based on the cards they can obtain from loot and in synergy with the relics they obtain. Like other deck-building, too many weak cards or the unplayable cards dilute the player's deck, and the player must strategically decide which cards are the best fit to make the deck effective, when to turn down additions of cards, or when to spend money to remove cards as to maximize the deck's strength.  Slay the Spire features metagaming aspects. Completed or failed runs contribute points towards unlocking new characters or new relics and cards that will be made available for the specific character. Ascension mode provides several challenges to the player such as to climb the tower with a character using only their starting relic or without adding any rare cards to their decks. A daily challenge gives players a single chance to get as high in the spire as they can under pre-set conditions and a fixed random seed, so that each player is starting from the same point and see the same encounters.

970,Slender The Arrival,/wiki/Slender_The_Arrival,Survival horror,Blue Isle Studios,Blue Isle Studios,Unreleased,"June 20, 2019","June 20, 2019"," The majority of the game takes place in abandoned areas (house, defunct mine, etc.), each with different objectives. Slender: The Arrival uses similar mechanics to its predecessor, The Eight Pages. The character is armed only with a flashlight. This limited defense forces a sense of helplessness, as the best way to survive in the game is to run whenever in danger. The Slender Man's behavior changes slightly between levels. In the first level, the Slender Man can be seen outside the window, and after going through the gate outside he can be seen on the top of hills well away from the player. In level two, he most often teleports off-screen or just out of the character's line of sight, but is capable of appearing directly in front of the player. It is observed that his motion centers around following the player, but consists largely of jumping from place to place, the inconvenience of which is increased as each of the eight pages are collected. His behavior is much the same as this in level four, except more active. In level three, he pursues much less aggressively, though is capable of teleporting directly in front of the player. In this level, the main antagonist is a girl who chases the player (most often following her path directly, but has been seen teleporting. It is unknown whether this is a glitch or an in-game mechanic). The only way of subduing her is by focusing the flashlight (on its second setting) on her. While looking at the Slender Man, the camera succumbs to electronic distortions such as static, blurring, color spots, audio distortion, etc., which obstructs the player's vision unless facing away, and far enough from it. The player cannot pause while this occurs, to prevent them taking a break due to being frightened. When caught, the game over screen is also different; while in Slender: The Eight Pages, the player saw a white static background with Slender Man's faceless head, the one for Slender: The Arrival is black, with an overhead-lit and color-distorted hue and less static. There are also new choices in difficulty (which must first be unlocked by completing the game once) being easy, normal, and hardcore. In hardcore, the flashlight can run out, enemies are more aggressive and the player's stamina runs out quickly. Easy has infinite flashlight, a great deal of stamina, and the enemies are not very aggressive.   Slender: The Arrival follows the story of two childhood friends, Lauren and Kate, after the events in Slender: The Eight Pages. Kate (believed to be the young girl in the Eight Pages) is selling her childhood home.  Lauren, in response to several unsettling letters Kate had sent her, visits her childhood friend. With the sun setting, Lauren discovers Kate's home, doors ajar, furniture and belongings disheveled. On the walls of Kate's room are scrawlings of an ominous figure and haunting messages. Lauren hears a woman's scream coming from a shattered window. Searching for her friend, Lauren heads towards the sound, into the wooded park behind the house. She activates three generators to light up the path and finds a burnt farmhouse. Inside is Charlie Matheson Jr., a boy who had disappeared years ago and is now deformed. He disappears when Lauren approaches him.  Lauren searches the wooded area for clues as to the whereabouts of her friend but only finds more scribbled drawings. As she ventures deeper into the park, scopaesthesia causes her to encounter a tall, faceless figure named Slender Man. After all eight pages are collected, Lauren runs from Slender Man, slipping down an embankment, hitting her head and passing out.  She regains consciousness in the morning. Still searching for Kate, Lauren stumbles upon an old abandoned coal mine. To get out, Lauren attempts to power the emergency lift by activating six generators. Her progress is hindered by the attack of a figure known as the Chaser, who is afraid of the light of Lauren's flashlight. Slender Man later attempts to attack Lauren in the mine.  Lauren escapes and uses the lift to get out of the mine. She reaches a storage outpost with a television and two tapes. One shows Kate hurriedly scribbling upon papers. When Kate discovers that Slender Man is trying to get in, she starts to close every door and window in the house, but Slender Man manages to get inside. Kate then runs back to her room where Slender Man suddenly appears inside. Kate appears to jump out of the bedroom window before the tape abruptly ends. The other tape shows Carl Ross, a friend of Kate, investigating a farm where he repairs a pulley system, finds gas canisters to power a generator, and looks for a key to unlock a gate to a chapel. Charlie pursues him and eventually chases him away. Along the way, Lauren can find a teddy bear. Interacting with it starts a level where Charlie is playing on the beach and after collecting a trail of toy trains that lead him into the woods, he is caught by Slender Man.  Lauren continues up the mountainside towards a radio tower. Slender Man attempts to capture Lauren while she avoids fire and falling trees within a burning forest.  Lauren narrowly escapes her attacker in the hallways of the radio tower building and looks for a key to unlock a door. Her flashlight's batteries die as she goes through the door, only to find she has reached a dead end, containing a burnt body, a fire, and a camera with the recording of two panicked people. Shortly after listening, the corridor goes dark and Charlie runs towards Lauren accompanied by flashing images of Charlie before blacking out.  An additional level takes place after Kate fled into the woods where she collected the eight pages while being followed by Slender Man, after finding all the pages Slender Man catches her, claiming that he ""has plans for her"".  If the player has beaten the game once before, a Hardcore difficulty option will unlock, which is like the first game but more difficult. One difference is that Lauren must find gas canisters in order to power the generators in the mine. Before a game update, upon completion of the game again, Lauren will attempt to escape by jumping from a high area, in which her camera dies after she does so. After an update to the game, this ending is no longer possible to get. The game now ends with Lauren awake in the basement of the farmhouse from earlier with Charlie blocking the way out. After finding two documents, Charlie disappears. Lauren hears crying upstairs and finds Kate, but Kate turns into the Chaser and attacks her. Lauren's camera turns back on temporarily to show someone's legs being dragged away.  A secret level is also unlockable, which takes place at Kate's house in the daytime. The player's character is unknown but the goal of the level is to travel from room to room while avoiding Slender Man.  "
971,Smite,/wiki/Smite_(video_game),Multiplayer online battle arena,Titan Forge Games,Hi-Rez Studios,"February 20, 2019","January 24, 2019","January 24, 2019"," Smite features many different game modes with the largest being Conquest. Players are formed into two teams with five players on each team. All players begin at opposite sides of a map at their team's ""fountain"". Before the players enter the map, they are granted an amount of gold (usually 1,500) to buy starting items. These items grant special bonuses or abilities that enhance the player's god. There are three continuous ""lanes"" running from one side of the map to the other. Each lane is defended by a ""Phoenix"" which is accompanied by a pair of extra defensive towers. Phoenixes and towers deal a large amount of damage to any enemies that come too close. The goal of each game is to destroy the opposing team's Phoenixes and the Titan, a giant warrior who must be defeated to win the game. The players are accompanied by ""minions"", small soldiers with a weak attack. These minions spawn at the Phoenixes every thirty seconds and run along their lane until they meet opposition and attack immediately. Minions will attack not only players and other minions, but also towers, Phoenixes, and the Titan. In fact, their presence is required for players to deal full damage to these objectives. Defensive positions will prioritize enemy minions over players, allowing players to attack a tower without receiving damage; however, towers will fire upon players if there are no minions nearby or the player attacks an enemy player under their tower. If a game is going badly for a certain team, they can decide to surrender after at least 10 minutes, though this requires a majority of the team (4 players to 1) to agree.  With every game, players have to choose a god or other figure to play as. Currently, players can choose between 110 characters from 15 different pantheons: Arthurian, Celtic, Chinese, Egyptian, Great Old Ones, Greek, Hindu, Japanese, Mayan, Norse, Polynesian, Roman, Slavic, Voodoo, and Yoruba. Each character is classified as one of the following classes: Assassin, Guardian, Hunter, Mage, or Warrior. Unless otherwise stated, two players on the same team cannot choose the same character (in competitive modes and those using a Draft pick method, each player much use a different character). The player controls the god in a third person perspective, which is a unique characteristic of this MOBA, as other games of this genre are typically played from a top-down perspective. Each god has a basic attack, a passive trait, and four abilities with varying effects, such as area damage, crowd control, buffs, and many more. These abilities are acquired and upgraded when the player's character levels up by gaining experience from being in range of minions when they are killed, taking down towers or phoenixes, and defeating enemy characters. The maximum level is 20 and each successive level is more difficult to reach. Gold, which is used to buy items that increase power, defense, and passive effects, potions, wards and abilities, is accumulated through standard periodic income, by slaying enemies (player and NPC alike), or by selling owned items.  The large areas between the lanes make up what is called the ""jungle"", where computer-controlled monsters such as packs of cyclopes or Furies (the latter alternately referred to as harpies) periodically spawn at specific locations distributed symmetrically across the map. Killing certain monsters in said jungle causes a ""buff"" to drop on the ground where it can be picked up by a player. This buff grants the player one of the following for a limited time, depending on which monster was killed: mana (mana regen & cooldown reduction bonus), damage (basic damage & power bonus), speed (movement speed bonus), attack speed (in-hand attack speed & power bonus) or protection reduction aura (negation of some of the protections of enemy players within 55 units). There are three special neutral monsters who spawn less frequently: the Fire Giant, Gold Fury, and Pyromancer. When killed, they grant the entire team who killed it a powerful damage buff for a medium length of time, set amount of Gold, and a speed boost when coming out of the base respectively. There are also some monsters which do not offer a buff, only experience and gold.  "

The game has 15 levels across four themed worlds. It takes place in the fictional jungle setting of Haven Tor. The first world is themed around the jungle, the second around water, the third around lava, and the fourth around winds. Each world contains four levels, except for the final world which contains three. In each world the goal is to collect three colored gemstones called Keystones in order to reopen a portal to finish the level. In addition to the Keystones, there are 2 additional optional collectible types: Blue Whisps and gold Gatekeeper Coins. There are 20 Blue Whisps in each level, which are scattered along the critical path of the level, and five Gatekeeper Coins, which are put in more difficult to reach places. The controls in snake pass are unconventional and  mirrors the slithering of a snake. The player can move Noodle's head 360 degrees on a flat plane, lift it up, move forwards, tighten your grip, and call Doodle to lift Noodle's tail. However, moving forwards in a straight line moves the snake slowly, so you have to slither in order to gain speed. Noodle's body is made up of many small segments, so each can act independently from one another, and so Noodle's body reacts naturally to gravity. In the game you have to wrap your body around different objects in order to stay secure and not fall, as well as to move up structures. Different worlds introduce different mechanics, in addition to wrapping yourself around bamboo structures: in water Noodle can move in full 3D; winds will blow Noodle around; spikes,  lava, and falling off the island will result in Noodle dying. When he dies, he respawns back at the last checkpoint, which the player activities by touching. You lose all your collectibles since you last touched a checkpoint.  After each level is beaten, you unlock a time trial mode for speedrunning the game. After beating the game you unlock Snake Vision, a new power where the player can see all the collectibles to be collected in a level when standing still, and an arcade mode for each level in which you collect fruit for points under a time limit.   Doodle finds that a mysterious intruder is stealing the Keystones that allow travel in the gates between the lands. She wakes Noodle and together they set off to find the intruder, traveling to the top of Haven Tor along the way. In each of the worlds they see big black feathers and a large flying figure along the way. At the end of each world, the ruler of that realm thanks Noodle and Doodle and gives them a treasure. At the end of the final realm, they see that the magpie was looking for something shiny in order to reopen a portal to take them home. In approaching the bird, the 4 gifts given to Noodle and Doodle from the ruler of each realm work as keys and reveal ""the Great Shiny."" It then activates the portal which allows the bird to go home.   "
974,Sniper Elite III,/wiki/Sniper_Elite_III,Tactical shooter,Rebellion Developments,Rebellion Developments,"December 19, 2019","October 1, 2019","October 1, 2019"," The game retains and builds on the mechanics of Sniper Elite V2. Players go through large battlefield maps based on the North African conflict.  The sniper rifle is the player's primary weapon, though additional weapons, including submachine guns and pistols, silenced or not depending on the situation, are available. In addition to hand grenades, the player can deploy tripwire booby traps, land mines and dynamite. Binoculars can be used to tag enemies, displaying their position and movements. The player-character must hold their breath to properly line up the shot. A red icon appears in the scope, marking the projected point of impact. There are weapon parts spread out all over the game, found when looting dead enemies, allowing players to customise their weapons in the pre-deployment menu; the menu also allows equipment loadouts.  Stealth mechanics have been reworked. An eye icon squints or opens to denote the player's level of detection by the enemy. Enemy soldiers will also have a circle meter over their heads to indicate alert status. Players are also forced to relocate periodically to prevent detection with a white ghost image to mark their last known position and the enemy will search a wider area. As in the previous game, loud sounds may be used to mask sniper shots.  A points system is instituted for actions such as stealth close-combat or sniper kills, with the points accumulating towards promotion to higher ranks. Players can go around the map to collect special reward items such as collectors' cards and unlock sniper nests. Journal pages also provide further backstory into the events of the game.  V2's X-Ray kill cam system is retained as well. Where the previous game only shows the body's internal structure at point of impact, the new game expands to visualize the rest of the cardiovascular, skeletal, and muscular systems. The player can still target vehicles, but now has a chance to shoot the engines and disable the vehicle.   In June 1942, during the Battle of Gazala, SOE sniper Karl Fairburne (Tom Clarke-Hill) is sent to assassinate General Franz Vahlen and uncover his top-secret project. He helps British soldiers repel General Erwin Rommel's forces, but ultimately, the port of Tobruk is lost. Fairburne heads to the Gaberoune oasis in Libya to kill several officers and reveal Vahlen's whereabouts. He only finds a document revealing the name of Vahlen's project, Project Seuche (literally meaning plague). The Long Range Desert Group asks for Fairburne's assistance in destroying several Flak 88s in Halfaya Pass.  Fairburne's only hope of finding Vahlen is by rescuing a British informant inside Fort Rifugio previously held by the British during Operation Compass. Fairburne successfully infiltrates Fort Rifugio and frees the informant. The man, Brauer, shares intelligence about officers meeting at the Siwa Oasis in Western Egypt. Fairburne, whose sniping has earned him the label Wüstengeist (Desert Ghost) by the Germans, sneaks into the town and finds out that the officers plan to betray Vahlen to Hitler by giving him the general's personal diary in Berlin. Fairburne kills the officer tasked as the courier and steals the book, which details Vahlen's plans to conquer Europe when the Afrika Korps win in North Africa, with his base of operations somewhere in the Kasserine Pass.  Fairburne and Brauer infiltrate the base and discover from a secret movie reel that Project Seuche is a supertank codenamed Ratte. Tragically, Brauer is killed by a Tiger tank but Fairburne destroys it in revenge. He buries Brauer and takes a round from Brauer's gun. With the location of the Ratte production facility still unknown, Fairburne joins the LRDG in assaulting the German-controlled Pont du Fahs Airfield and finds a map leading to the facility, which is nestled inside the Mides canyon. He gets inside the complex and prepares satchel charges to collapse the base as well as destroy the Ratte prototype. To trigger the detonation, Fairburne puts an explosive on the Ratte's turret and drops a load of the supertank's massive shells on it. Vahlen is mortally injured trying to escape the hangar and Fairburne takes his Luger, puts Brauer's round in the chamber and kills Vahlen before escaping the base.  A voiceover by Fairburne during the end credits reveals that the intelligence he acquired on the Ratte enables the USAAF and the RAF to launch the Battle of the Ruhr. The effect of Operation Chastise on steel production forces the Germans to scrap work on the Ratte.  "
975,Sniper Elite V2 Remastered,/wiki/Sniper_Elite_V2_Remastered,Tactical shooter,Rebellion Developments,Rebellion Developments,"October 31, 2019","May 14, 2019","May 21, 2019"," Sniper Elite V2 is a third-person tactical shooter that emphasises a less direct approach to combat, encouraging the player as a sniper to use stealth and keep distance from enemy soldiers. Many of the single player levels allow multiple routes for the players to take, including multi-story buildings and side streets to get vantage points and avoid direct firefights. Set in World War II, the player character utilises appropriate weapons for the era. The sniper rifle is the primary weapon throughout the game, though additional side arms are available including submachine guns and pistols, silenced or not depending on the situation. In addition to hand grenades, the player can deploy them as tripwire booby traps, land mines and dynamite. Binoculars can be used to tag enemies in view, displaying their position and movements to player. When using the sniper rifle however, certain elements can determine the outcome of a shot, taking realistic ballistics into consideration including wind direction and strength and bullet drop potentially altering the shot through the scope.  Bullets can ricochet off surfaces or targets and strike others. In different postures such as crouching or lying down on the front can also steady a shot, however the player character also has the ability to take a deep breath to further steady a shot and from their perspective slow down time. Another ability is when the player character is spotted, their last movements and position to the enemy is shown as a white-outlined figure, potentially allowing the player to escape that area and avoid further detection and alarms being raised.  A major feature of V2 is the ""X-Ray Kill Cam"" where upon a successful and skilled shot will in slow motion follow the bullet from the sniper rifle to the target where upon impact will show an anatomically correct x-ray style reveal of the body part being hit and the damage the bullet causes to the organs and bones. Sniping can also be used to shoot the enemies' own grenades triggering an explosion. This method can also be used against military vehicles by targeting fuel tanks and valves. The game will also measure notable shots by briefly displaying distance and other factors like whether it was a head shot or moving target.   The main character is Lieutenant Karl Fairburne (Tom Clarke-Hill), an American OSS officer and skilled sniper who is inserted into Berlin in 1945, during the final days of World War II. It references Operation Paperclip and its predecessor Operation Overcast, the plan by the US to recruit the scientists of Nazi Germany. Fairburne comes up against both Nazi and Soviet opponents as he tracks key individuals involved with the development of the V-2 ballistic missile.  The campaign begins with Fairburne sent into Berlin to first assassinate German Major-General Hans von Eisenberg who was attempting to defect to the Soviets. Shortly after, he is given the mission to eliminate Doctor Gunther Kreidl, a Nazi scientist who is being led out of the city in a convoy. After laying an ambush, Fairburne escapes with the doctor's personal documents revealing further information about the V-2 rocket program including the location of other scientists. As the only American within the region, he is sent to the outskirts of the city to infiltrate a V-2 production facility in search of another scientist, Dr. Schwaiger. While the scientist is absent, Fairburne learns that he originally made plans to defect to the United States, before sabotaging and escaping the facility. US intelligence then sends him into Opernplatz where the Soviets are in full invading force. As the Soviets and Germans engage one another, Fairburne slips by and saves Schwaiger from being executed by Nazi officers after his plans to defect were discovered. However, in the ensuing firefight, Schwaiger is mortally wounded and in his dying words states that ""Wolff has a plan"" and the unknown word ""tabun"". Following these events, Fairburne continues to track and eliminate the remaining scientists, assassinating Doctor Müller in his command tower during a series of bombing raids on the city.  With no location of the V-2 launching site, Fairburne infiltrates and searches the Soviet HQ. There he finds that documents revealing that tabun is actually a nerve gas that is to be carried by the V-2 rockets. As a last act of revenge the remaining scientist Doctor Wolff intends to launch them at London. With only the information that location is somewhere outside Berlin, Fairburne goes to Wolff's offices within the city to find more information. However, by the time he arrives the office has been already destroyed, yet Fairburne is able to find a ripped notebook and learns that Wolff is about to escape from an airfield. Fairburne retrieves a map detailing V-2 storage facilities and sets out to destroy the rockets before they can be launched. He arrives at the launch site with minutes until launch. After destroying the rocket, and with only Wolff left, Fairburne goes back to the Brandenburg Gate, where he had assassinated von Eisenberg few days earlier. Fairburne climbs on top of the structure and, as Wolff is about to escape in a car, shoots and kills Wolff, causing the car to lose control and flip over. Fairburne remarks that World War II is over but the Cold War has just begun, in which he has acted as the first soldier.  "

987,Sonic Forces,/wiki/Sonic_Forces,Platformer,Sonic Team,Sega,"November 9, 2017","November 7, 2017","November 7, 2017"," Sonic Forces is an action-adventure platform game similar in gameplay and style to prior Sonic the Hedgehog games. The player's goal is to defeat Doctor Eggman and his robot army. The game features three playable characters: two variants of Sonic the Hedgehog (""Classic"" and ""Modern""), and the ""Avatar"" (the player's custom character). Each has unique abilities and attributes: Classic Sonic is restricted to side-scrolling gameplay reminiscent of the Sega Genesis Sonic games and can perform a spin dash on the ground and a drop dash in mid-air to gain speed. Modern Sonic's gameplay follows a similar style to Sonic Unleashed and Sonic Colors: he can double jump, perform a homing attack on enemies, springs, and grappling hooks, and a speed boost by collecting White Wisps. The Avatar is created from a base of seven animal types, which each possess a unique ability; they also wield a grappling hook and can equip weapons known as Wispons, including flamethrowers, whips, and hammers. Depending on the Wispon, Avatars can use temporary abilities by collecting a corresponding Wisp type. Certain parts see players controlling both Modern Sonic and the Avatar, switching between them as necessary, similar to Sonic Heroes.  The game is split into several themed levels, some of which are based on locations from past games, such as Green Hill Zone. Players must complete each level while fighting waves of enemies, and (with the exception of Classic Sonic) seamlessly shift from side-scrolling to third-person perspectives. Stages are filled with features such as spring boards, rails, and boost pads, and obstacles such as spikes, bottomless pits, and robots. Scattered around levels are golden rings, which serve as a form of health: rings protect players from damage caused by robots or other hazards, though they lose their rings upon being hit; being hit with no rings kills the player. The game does not use a traditional life system, instead deducting from the player's score depending on the number of deaths. Players are given a grade dependent on their performance; an ""S"" rank is the best and a ""C"" is the worst. Certain levels feature a boss, which must be defeated in order to proceed. Bonus levels can be unlocked by collecting Red Rings hidden in most stages and players may occasionally receive SOS Missions, tasking them with replaying levels with a specific objective.   Doctor Eggman attacks a city, and Sonic sets out to stop him. Upon arriving he is attacked by Infinite, a mercenary transformed by the power of the Phantom Ruby from Sonic Mania. Infinite defeats Sonic, and he is taken prisoner aboard the Death Egg. Without Sonic, the land is left without a defender, and Eggman, with the help of his robots, Infinite, Shadow the Hedgehog, Chaos, Zavok, and Metal Sonic, manages to conquer the world within 6 months. Knuckles the Echidna forms a resistance force with Tails, the Chaotix, Amy Rose, Silver the Hedgehog, Rouge the Bat and a survivor of Eggman's attack whom they nickname the Rookie. Knuckles discovers Sonic's whereabouts, and the Rookie steals a space shuttle, breaks into the Death Egg, and rescues Sonic. Back in the city, Tails is attacked by Chaos, but is saved by Classic Sonic (who ended up in Modern Sonic's world following the events of Sonic Mania). The two set out to spy on Eggman, learning of the Phantom Ruby and that Eggman has a plan to completely destroy the Resistance which will take effect in three days.  Meanwhile, Sonic encounters Shadow, who reveals that the Shadow following Eggman is a fake virtual reality copy created by Infinite, as are the other villains serving him. Tails infiltrates Eggman's computer network and finds the Phantom Ruby's weakness: it is directly powered by the Death Egg's core, and without a power source it is useless. While the Rookie stages a diversion, Classic and Modern Sonic destroy the Death Egg. Believing they have the upper hand, the Resistance attacks Eggman's capital Metropolis. However, Eggman has a hidden backup power source under Metropolis, and as Modern Sonic and company make their final charge against the mountaintop Eggman Empire Fortress, he makes Infinite create a massive sun over the planet so that it will crash down and destroy the entire Resistance. Thinking fast, the Rookie uses a prototype Phantom Ruby they had recovered to dispel the virtual sun, saving everybody. Sonic and the Rookie then battle Infinite and defeat him. Eggman unveils yet another backup plan, moving the Phantom Ruby into one of his Death Egg Robots and fighting Sonic and his friends directly. Working together, the Rookie Avatar and the two Sonics destroy Eggman's robot and defeat him. With the Phantom Ruby neutralized, all the copies serving Eggman's army vanish, Classic Sonic returns home, the Resistance disbands, and Modern Sonic and his friends set out to rebuild the world while the Rookie leaves to find their own way.

988,Sonic Mania,/wiki/Sonic_Mania,Platformer,Headcannon,Sega,"August 16, 2017","August 15, 2017","August 15, 2017"," Sonic Mania is a side-scrolling platformer similar to the early Sonic the Hedgehog games released for the Sega Genesis. Players select one of 3 playable characters, each with their own unique abilities: Sonic can perform a ""drop dash"" which sends him rolling in a dash after a jump, Tails can fly and swim, and Knuckles can glide and climb walls. As with Sonic 2 (1992), players can play as Sonic and Tails simultaneously, or a second player can control Tails independently. Unlockable options include Sonic's abilities from Sonic CD (1993) and Sonic 3 & Knuckles (1994) in place of the drop dash and ""& Knuckles"" mode, which allows simultaneous control of any character and Knuckles, including himself.  Sonic Mania takes place over 12 levels, called zones; the game features eight ""remixed"" zones, such as Green Hill Zone from the first Sonic game (1991), alongside four original ones. Remixed stages consist of both new elements and recycled gimmicks and ideas from other past Sonic games. Each zone is divided into 2 acts, in which the player must guide their character past various enemies and obstacles to reach the end. At the end of each act, the player takes part in a boss battle against Dr. Robotnik or one of his robots, including the Hard-Boiled Heavies, elite henchmen based on the EggRobo enemies from Sonic 3 & Knuckles. The player collects golden rings, which serve as a form of health; players survive hits as long as they have at least one ring, but, if hit, their rings scatter and disappear after a short time. Television monitors containing rings, elemental shields, or power-ups such as invincibility and faster running speed are scattered throughout each level. Like Sonic 3 & Knuckles, the story is told via short in-game cutscenes between levels.  Giant rings hidden in each act, a feature of the original games, lead to pseudo-3D special stages similar to those in Sonic CD, where players can attempt to collect a Chaos Emerald. In special stages, players dodge obstacles and collect colored spheres to increase their speed, allowing them to pursue a UFO carrying a Chaos Emerald; collecting all seven Chaos Emeralds allows players to use their character's super transformation and unlocks the game's true ending. Players' ring counters slowly decrease during special stages and must be continually replenished; if the player runs out of rings before they catch the UFO, the special stage ends. The ""Blue Sphere"" special stages from Sonic the Hedgehog 3 also return, repurposed as bonus stages that are accessed by entering a portal that appears when the player passes a checkpoint while carrying 25 or more rings. Completing bonus stages earns the player a silver or gold medal depending on their performance; collecting medals unlocks features such as a debug mode and sound test.  In a time attack mode, players must complete levels as quickly as possible, with the best times included on an online leaderboard; players can instantly reload a level to try again at any time. A split-screen competitive multiplayer mode allows two players to race to the end of a level, similar to those of Sonic 2. Players can also unlock ""Mean Bean"", a 2-player minigame based on Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.   Following the events of Sonic & Knuckles, Sonic and Tails detect a powerful energy reading on Angel Island and board their biplane, the Tornado, to investigate. However, Dr. Robotnik sends an elite group of EggRobos to reach the signal before Sonic and Tails. The EggRobos excavate the source of the signal, a magical gemstone called the Phantom Ruby, just as Sonic and Tails arrive. The EggRobos gain new powers from the ruby, becoming the Hard Boiled Heavies, and send Sonic, Tails, and the island's guardian, Knuckles, through zones they have previously visited where they pursue Robotnik to prevent him from using the ruby's power for evil, clashing with him and the Heavies along the way.  Sonic and his allies discover that Robotnik has used the Phantom Ruby's power to retake control of Little Planet from Sonic CD. They board Robotnik's robotic fortress, defeat him and the Heavies, and escape just as it explodes. If all 7 Chaos Emeralds are collected while playing as Sonic, the Phantom Ruby transports him and Robotnik to another dimension. There, the Heavy King betrays Robotnik and takes the ruby, imbuing himself with power; Robotnik attacks the Heavy to try to reclaim it. Sonic uses the Chaos Emeralds to become Super Sonic and fights Robotnik and the Heavy King separately to keep the ruby out of their possession. After the battle, the Phantom Ruby reacts with the Emeralds, negating Sonic's super state and creating a wormhole that engulfs itself and Sonic as Little Planet vanishes.  "

990,South Park The Fractured but Whole,/wiki/South_Park_The_Fractured_but_Whole,Role-playing,Ubisoft San Francisco,Ubisoft,Unreleased,"April 24, 2018","April 24, 2018"," South Park: The Fractured but Whole is a role-playing video game that is viewed from a 2.5D, third-person perspective. The player controls the New Kid as they explore the fictional Colorado town of South Park, around which the player-character can be freely moved. A fast-travel system allows the character to be moved between unlocked travel points.  The game allows the player to select one of ten archetypal superhero player-characters; the nimble Speedster, the short-range, high damage Brutalist, the long range, moderate damage Blaster, the weather-based Elementalist, the offense-attracting Cyborg, the long-range, status effecting Psychic, the stealthy Assassin, the gadget-using Gadgeteer, the healing Plantmancer, and the high-damage, swift Martial Artist. At first only three choices are available (Blaster, Speedster, and Brutalist); the New Kid can eventually access all ten classes, freely matching powers from the available classes, for example, the player can use the Blaster's fire blasts, the Assassin's knives, and the Martial Artist's kicks. The player can assign four powers from the classes, three regular attacks and one ultimate attack. Ultimate attacks can only be used after filling the Ultimate bar, a pool of points shared between the New Kid and their allies that is increased by completing timed button presses during attacking and defending phases. Throughout the game, the player can select up to three allies from twelve characters to accompany them in battle, each possessing three powers and an ultimate attack.  The Fractured but Whole retains the turn-based combat of the previous game in the series, South Park: The Stick of Truth (2014). Instead of taking place on a static plane, battles are fought on a variable-size grid on which the player and enemies can move freely to create strategic advantages. The grid can contain environmental hazards such as exploding chemical barrels, and lava (red Lego bricks). The player selects attacks from a menu. Attacks can be augmented with contextual button presses for extra damage. Timed button presses during enemy attacks can recover some health after being hit and increase the Ultimate meter. Attacks offer effects including abilities with ""knockback"" damage, which can be used to forcibly move an opponent around the battlefield and inflict status effects such as poisoning, freezing, burning, and bleeding, which inflict damage over time.  Each attack affects a different area of the grid, requiring strategic positioning to hit enemies and avoid attacks. The attacker can increase damage by knocking targets into each other or into an ally. Healing items can be used in battle, requiring one turn per use. The player can collect artifacts and equipment to boost the player's Might, making them stronger in battle and offering benefits such as increased defense; more artifacts can be used as the player's level increases. The player-character has a DNA slot, allowing them to use strands of DNA to boost attributes called Brawn, Brains, Health, Spunk, and Move. The non-player character, PC Principal, can teach the player to recognize microaggressions, which allows the player a free in-battle attack against an enemy. Some characters, such as Jimbo and Ned, Classi, Gerald Broflovski, and Moses, can be summoned during battle; Moses heals all allies while the others deliver powerful attacks.  The New Kid can manipulate time with their farts; this ability can be used in battle to skip an opponent's turn, pause time to move around the grid and inflict out-of-turn damage, or summon a past version of the New Kid to join the battle. The New Kid's farting power can also be used to reverse time, fix objects, and pause time to avoid obstacles or fast-moving targets. Some areas of the town are inaccessible until the player gains specific allies who can use the New Kid's farting power to overcome the obstacle: Captain Diabetes can be sent into a rage that allows him to move heavy objects; the Human Kite can fly the New Kid to otherwise unreachable heights; Toolshed's sandblaster can clear paths that are blocked by lava that cause the player to combust; and Professor Chaos can launch a hamster from the New Kid's rectum to reach and sabotage electrical panels.  The player can modify the New Kid's appearance, superpowers, gender, sexuality, race, and ethnicity at any time in the game. Gender choices include male, female, and trigender. Costume items can be collected, mixed together and recolored but have no influence on the New Kid's abilities. The New Kid's race selector is represented as a difficulty level slider, with lighter skin being easy and darker skin being harder. The slider does not affect combat but affects the amount of money the player can receive and the way some characters speak to the New Kid.  The game has three combat difficulty levels, which affect the power of enemies in relation to the player; ""Casual"" (weaker enemies), ""Heroic"" (normal enemies), and ""Mastermind"" (stronger enemies). A crafting system allows the player to use recovered or purchased resources such as duct tape, glue, sports drink bottles, and taco-related products to craft items such as healing burritos and quesadillas, costumes, and artifacts. The player is encouraged to explore the wider game world to defecate in toilets in a mini-game, find yaoi art depicting intimate moments between the characters Tweek and Craig, or take self-portraits with town residents to increase their followers on Coonstagram, an Instagram-like social media feed. The player must amass a certain number of social media followers to complete certain story missions. The character's cellphone serves as the game's main menu, containing items including the inventory, character profiles, and active quests.  "

996,Spellbreak,/wiki/Spellbreak,Action,Proletariat,Proletariat,Unreleased,TBA,TBA," Like most battle royale games, Spellbreak drops a large number of players into an arena which slowly shrinks over time with the last surviving team declared the winner. The game differs from other Battle Royales, however, in that it uses magical spells in place of guns. Players can choose from one of six classes wind, fire, ice, lightning and toxic, which will determine their primary attack type. Each player starts with a gauntlet permanently attached to them which can deal out both primary and secondary attacks. Primary are unlimited but have a cooldown timer while secondary uses Mana and are limited. Elements from different classes can be combined to make spells more powerful although they can also cancel each other out if used incorrectly. Players are also able to pick up a secondary gauntlet during plays.  According to the developer the game also includes RPG and Roguelike elements.   "
997,Spelunker Party!,/wiki/Spelunker_Party!,Platform,Tozai Games,Square Enix,"April 20, 2017","October 19, 2017","October 19, 2017"," The player controls one of the four playable characters (Spelunker, Spelunkette, Dark Spelunker, and Spelunkette's Sister) in an attempt to discover treasures and reach the end of the expedition area for each level. There are a total of 100 stages to select from on a large world map. The map has four distinct sections with 25 levels each. Some of the stages occasionally become event stages - dropping an unusual amount of in-game currency or event items. This includes collaboration events featuring equipment based on other video game franchises. Once a stage has been selected, the player will have to navigate through the level by walking, jumping, and using tools at their disposal. The player can go on a solo expedition or join a six-player group online.  A finite amount of energy is available to the player's character and complete depletion would lead to death. Energy can be resupplied at checkpoints scattered throughout the cave. In case of deaths, the player's character will respawn at the last checkpoint they have passed through. Deaths can be easily caused by the hazardous environment such as traps, creatures, and ghosts. The playable characters are also known as the weakest action heroes, and they can die if you jump or fall from a slightly higher platform. Each level allows for two revives and a third death results in a game over screen. A continue can be purchased with moon gems. In multiplayer mode, other players can revive you at your last checkpoint even after you've expended your lives. However, they must reach you before the 30 second countdown ends.  Each cave is split into multiple sections, and the player is required to progress through them in order. Once a section has been cleared, the player cannot return to the previous area unless the level is restarted. Treasures known as Litho-orbs can be found throughout the level alongside items required for progression - such as colored keys that open corresponding doors. Litho-orbs go through a process known as Litho-stone evaluation at the end of the stage. The orbs are broken apart to reveal the Litho-stone fragments hidden in them. The yield is randomized, but the player would not receive a duplicate fragment until it has been used or sold. A storage space of 999 slots is available for the fragments.  Once all the fragments for a Litho-stone has been gathered, the player can complete it manually to receive the indicated equipment. Head and body equipment are available alongside accessories and pets. Equipment are used to enhance and provide new abilities for the playable characters. However, some equipment are specific to certain characters. An inventory box is available for equipment that offers 30 slots initially. The player can expand the box by five slots for every 100 moon gems. Moon gem is a premium currency purchasable through microtransactions. In spite of that, there are also in-game methods for earning them as well. Another currency, gold, can be obtained through normal gameplay. Gold can be used to upgrade equipment.  Equipment can also be gained through a method known as Doggie Digging. The feature can be accessed through the menu. The player can use in-game items, such as candies and cakes, to feed an orange spotted dog named Pooch. Pooch will then dig up a completed equipment. If those items are unavailable, the player can use moon gems instead.  "
998,Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy,/wiki/Sphinx_and_the_Cursed_Mummy,Action-adventure,THQ Nordic,THQ Nordic,Unreleased,"January 29, 2019","January 29, 2019"," The fictional version of Egypt in which the game is set is in a period of turmoil when the player is introduced to Sphinx, one of the main protagonists. He and his fellow apprentice Horus are given the task of retrieving the legendary Blade of Osiris by their master, Imhotep. They are taken to Uruk, ""the land of darkness"", where they eventually find the Blade. Horus is attacked and supposedly killed by a deadly ray that protects the Castle of Uruk. Sphinx retrieves the Blade, but while trying to escape is also attacked by the ray and forced to travel to an unknown location through the use of a portal system.  Meanwhile, the young Prince Tutenkhamen of Luxor celebrates his birthday, but his older brother, Akhenaten, captures him and performs a ritual that turns him into a mummy. Sphinx arrives and interrupts the ritual, causing Tutenkhamen, Akhenaten and his henchman Menes to be teleported to the Castle of Uruk. Sphinx learns that fragments of Tutenkhamen's soul are stored in Canopic Vases, and takes on the task of recollecting them to restore him to his former self. In the Castle, Akhenaten gloats that the recent events were nothing but a minor setback. The player then learns that ""Akhenaten"" is in fact the dark god Set in disguise, and that the real Akhenaten was mummified in the same way as Tutenkhamen to allow Set to assume his form. However, because of Sphinx's actions he cannot disguise himself as Tutenkhamen to take power in Luxor as planned.  Sphinx and Imhotep devise a plan to use the Mummy/Tutenkhamen's immortality to their benefit; a single Canopic Vase is able to bring him to life for a short while, but he still remains practically dead allowing him to safely venture the trap-riddled Castle of Uruk. Imhotep creates Bas-ket, who can sneak inside the castle to deliver the Vases to the Mummy. Throughout the story, the Mummy exploits his inability to be killed to survive the traps and retrieve valuable items to aid Sphinx in his quest. In return, Sphinx finds more Canopic Vases over the course of the game and uses Bas-ket to send them to his undead ally.  During his time in the city of Heliopolis, Sphinx learns that the god Anubis has caused great suffering to the people of the land; most prominently, he cast many of them into stone statues. Sphinx's heroic nature appeals to Anubis, and gradually allows him to free the people from their stone curse. However, the tasks given to Sphinx become more dangerous over time. Anubis asks him to retrieve ""Sacred Crowns"", immensely powerful objects once used by the gods of Egypt.  The first crown to retrieve is the Sacred Crown of Abydos, a city barraged by various disasters and troubles (though not apparent at first, the chaos is the work of Set). Most recently, the Mayor falls very ill and the Crown almost falls into the hands of his traitorous aides. Sphinx is able to save him and in return is rewarded with the crown.  Each crown presents a greater challenge for Sphinx than the previous; he battles and defeats the fearsome Geb Queen for possession of the Sacred Crown of Uruk, and the pharaoh of Heliopolis for the Crown of Heliopolis. As Sphinx proves his might to Anubis, the enigmatic god reveals he cast the people of Heliopolis into stone to protect them from the darkness that will soon descend upon Egypt at the hands of Set.  The Mummy discovers The Sacred Crown of Set, the final crown, in the depths of The Castle of Uruk. He takes it and this greatly weakens the ray protecting the castle. Bas-ket is able to escape with the crown, but Set catches the Mummy and paralyses him.  With all four Sacred Crowns, Anubis is able to summon Osiris, another god who reveals he and Set were once a single form named Ra. Set, however, became greedy and stole power from Osiris to take over Egypt. Osiris uses the last of his power to transport Sphinx past the defenses of The Castle of Uruk, where he challenges Set for the fate of all Egypt. Set takes on his ""true form""; a hideous monster with immense power, but Sphinx is able to defeat him. Set is not destroyed, indeed Imhotep appears and tells Sphinx that this is not in his destiny. Instead, Osiris arrives and forcibly reunites himself with the weakened Set and Ra is formed once again. Ra gives the Mummy the last Canopic Vase, but the Mummy tragically falls and breaks it. The game ends with a cliffhanger as Imhotep states there may be other ways to help Tutenkhamen regain his human form.  "

His main goal in life is to gather enough money to start his own shop, and he already has been traveling for seven years while gaining experience in the trade. One night when stopped at the town of Pasloe, he finds in his wagon a wolf-deity named Holo who is over 600 years old. She takes the form of a 15-year-old girl, except for a wolf's tail and ears. She introduces herself as the town's goddess of harvest, who has kept it blessed with good harvests of wheat for many years. Holo has experienced increasing isolation and disillusionment at the townpeople's move away from her protection towards their own methods of increasing the harvest.  She is especially hurt at their forgetting of the promise made between her and a farmer when she arrived in the village and their criticism of her as a ""fickle god"" for needing to replenish the soil with smaller harvests.  Because of these changes, she wants to go back to her homeland in the north called Yoitsu; she believes the people have already forsaken her and that she has kept her promise to maintain the good harvests. Holo also wants to travel to see how the world has changed while she has remained in one place for many years. She manages to bargain her way out of the village by making a deal with Lawrence to take her with him. As they travel, her wisdom helps increase his profits, but at the same time, her true nature draws unwanted attention from the Church.  "
1003,Splatoon 2,/wiki/Splatoon_2,Third-person shooter,Nintendo EPD,Nintendo,"July 21, 2017","July 21, 2017","July 21, 2017"," Like its predecessor, Splatoon 2 is a third-person shooter in which players control characters, known as Inklings and Octolings, and use colored ink as ammunition. Ink is also used to cover the ground, or any paintable surface, in order to swim or refill their ink tanks. Inklings and Octolings can morph between humanoid, or kid form,  where they switch from walking and shooting, into squid form where they can quickly swim through ink of their own color, and replenish their ink supply, as well as return to full health.  The sequel adds new standard, sub and special weapons, including dual-wield pistols called Dualies that allow the player to perform dodge rolls, shotgun-like weapons called Brellas that enable defensive maneuvers with folding shields, and jetpacks known as Inkjets. Like the previous game, it features the standard Turf War mode for Regular Battles, in which two four-player teams have three minutes to cover the most turf with their color of ink. Splatoon 2 also maintains the first game's rotation of Splat Zones, Tower Control and Rainmaker for Ranked Battles, unlocked at level ten, while also adding a new Clam Blitz mode. League Battles allow players to form teams with friends playing the same modes as in Ranked Battles. A new mode, Salmon Run, allows up to four players to team up cooperatively to tackle waves of enemies called Salmonids and collect Boss Salmonids' eggs.  Once per month until July 2019, a ""Splatfest"" event was held in which players could choose one of two teams, usually based on common debates such as heroes versus villains and pancakes versus waffles. In addition, there were two collaborations during these Splatfests: Nickelodeon's Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Splatfest themes were usually announced one week in advance, and players were given the ability to choose their team in the game's lobby. Themes were usually region-specific and happen at different times of the month. Splatfest battles were Turf Wars only, but players could choose between normal and pro modes. Winning battles awarded 'clout' to the winning team, and at the end of the Splatfest, the winning side was decided by evaluating popularity and clout earned in both battle modes. All players who participate earn rare rewards, but players who chose the winning team receive a slightly higher cut. In July 2019, Nintendo announced that the final Splatfest would be held.  Splatfest was halted for 11 months until in May 2020 when a Splatfest was held; it is likely the actual final Splatfest.  The game features a single-player campaign called Hero Mode, in which the player rescues captured Zapfish across various levels while fighting off evil Octarians. Unlike the previous game's single-player campaign which had a pre-determined weapon set, the player can now earn various weapons, some of which are required when playing levels for the first time. In addition to Sunken Scrolls that unlock artwork and in-game lore, players can collect Sardinium to upgrade their Hero Mode weapons, and tickets that can be exchanged for temporary reward boosts in multiplayer battles, such as increased experience or in-game money. Using a single weapon to beat all of the Hero Mode levels grants the player a Hero Weapon Replica (identical to the campaign weapon) to use in multiplayer matches. In the Octo Expansion DLC, players play as an Octoling in a new single-player campaign featuring eighty missions in which the player teams up with Inkopolis veteran Cap’n Cuttlefish, as well as the fictional in-game pop band known as Off The Hook, which consists of the characters Pearl and Marina, to collect assorted items called “Thangs”, as well as defeat enemies along the way. Players can also play multiplayer online through an internet connection or play locally, although local play requires multiple consoles and copies of the game. The game also features LAN support with an adapter accessory for local private tournaments. The game supports amiibo figures, which allow players to store their character's custom look and unlock additional content. Free post-release updates and events are ongoing.   Splatoon 2 takes place approximately two years after the final Splatfest event of the first game, in which the pop idol Marie defeated her cousin and fellow Squid Sister, Callie. After having drifted apart in the months following the event, Marie worries that Callie was negatively affected by the result. After leaving Inkopolis to see her parents, Marie returns home to discover that the Great Zapfish that powers the city has gone missing again, as has Callie. Fearing that the evil Octarians are once more involved, Marie again takes up her role as Agent 2 of the New Squidbeak Splatoon and recruits an Inkling from Inkopolis Square, the player character, to become Agent 4 and investigate.  With assistance from Marie and weapons expert Sheldon, Agent 4 makes their way through Octo Canyon fighting Octarians and recovering several stolen Zapfish, including ones powering the Octarians' war machines, such as the Octo Oven, the Octo Samurai and the Octo Shower. They discover that Callie herself has sided with the Octarians after being brainwashed by their leader, DJ Octavio, who has escaped his imprisonment after his defeat in the first game and once more is using the Great Zapfish to power his new DJ stage, the Octobot King II. Marie arrives with Sheldon and frees Callie from her mind control, and together they help Agent 4 defeat Octavio once more. With the Great Zapfish safely returned to Inkopolis, the Squid Sisters happily reunite and resume their musical career.  "
1005,Spyro Reignited Trilogy,/wiki/Spyro_Reignited_Trilogy,Platform,Toys for Bob,Activision,Unreleased,"September 3, 2019","September 3, 2019"," Spyro Reignited Trilogy is a remaster of the original Spyro trilogy developed by Insomniac Games for the PlayStation: Spyro the Dragon, Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage!, and Spyro: Year of the Dragon. Each game is a 3D platformer featuring the titular protagonist, a juvenile purple dragon named Spyro, as he attempts to restore peace in a set of worlds specific to each game by vanquishing enemies. Spyro's sidekick, a dragonfly named Sparx, acts as his health, defending him from a limited number of enemy attacks. Additionally, the games feature a number of collectibles which must be acquired to make progress, such as gems, which also act as currency, and dragon eggs.  Spyro Reignited Trilogy attempts to remain faithful to the gameplay of the original games. Each level is designed to match the size and layout of the levels in the originals. A few features, present in only one or two of the original trilogy, were unified across all three games in Reignited, such as the addition of ""skill points"" in the first game, or Spyro's ability to roll from side-to-side in later installments.  The remaster also made a few changes to content in the originals that was no longer considered appropriate. Some enemies in the first game, for example, wielded semi-automatic weapons in the original PlayStation version of the game; they wield paintball guns in the Reignited version. Additionally, a genie character in Ripto's Rage! had its name changed from ""Bombo"" to ""Bob the Flagkeeper"" to avoid referencing a stereotype of Arabs and Muslims common since before the publication of the original game.  However, most of the game's differences from the originals center around quality-of-life improvements. All of Spyro's lines were re-recorded by Tom Kenny in all three games of Reignited. Visual graphics were overhauled, and non-playable characters were given more distinct and varied personalities. The soundtrack was also re-recorded, with the options to play ""dynamic"" versions of the new recordings, where tempo is adjusted with Spyro's movement, or switch back to the original recordings.  "

It also includes all of the racers featured in the movie as well as additional competitors exclusive to the game. The player character's podracer is equipped with a boost function that the player can activate. While activated the podracer's temperature will rise, and if the player boosts for too long, the engines will explode, destroying the podracer and costing the player several seconds as he/she respawns to continue racing.  The podracer will also be destroyed if one or both engines sustain severe damage from colliding into too many walls or obstacles, requiring the player to steer carefully to avoid falling behind. The player can also actively repair the podracer while competing, however doing so results in a slower overall speed until repairs are either complete or stopped.  Three single player game modes are available in the game. In Tournament mode, the player character competes in a championship. Completing races awards money, with higher ranked finishes resulting in higher payouts. This can be used to buy parts or repair droids, unlock new tracks, and unlock new racers.  Free Race mode allows the player to practice any previously unlocked courses using any unlocked racer. The player character cannot earn money or unlock tracks and racers, but can set the difficulty of the opponents. Time Attack pits the player character against the clock, racing along to try to complete the fastest time on the given course. This mode is absent from the PC version. Instead the Free Play mode allows the player to set the number of computer opponents to 0.  Multiplayer is also offered on all platforms, though it differs between the PC and console versions. The Nintendo 64 and Sega Dreamcast versions feature a two player splitscreen mode, while the Windows and Macintosh versions allow for play over a Local Area Network (LAN). This Windows version uses the deprecated IPX  protocol to accomplish this, while the Macintosh version uses the TCP/IP stack. The multiplayer mode can support up to 8 players.  "
1009,Star Wars Jedi Knight Jedi Academy,/wiki/Star_Wars_Jedi_Knight_Jedi_Academy,First-person shooter,Raven Software,NA,Unreleased,"March 26, 2020","March 26, 2020"," As a first and third-person shooter set in the Star Wars expanded universe, Jedi Academy puts the player into combat wielding a variety of firearms from that universe, as well as lightsabers and Force powers. The player can choose perspective for every weapon except for the lightsaber, which must be wielded in a third person view. The shooter aspects of the game are standard, including a variety of projectile and energy weapons and explosives. Players have a health meter and a shield meter, which are replenished separately.  In both single-player and multiplayer, the player character is a Force-user, who has access to a variety of Force powers in addition to their lightsaber(s). Powers include Push, Pull, Jump, Heal, Lightning, and other abilities from the Star Wars universe. Force powers are categorized into core, Light (defensive) and Dark (offensive), and each Force power has three ranks, with the power increasing in effectiveness with each rank. In both single-player and multiplayer, players choose how to rank up their powers, adding a layer of customization. During gameplay, the player has a ""Force meter"" which is depleted when powers are used, and recharges when no powers are in use.  Jedi Academy places a heavy emphasis on lightsaber combat. The player can create a custom lightsaber by selecting a hilt and one of five blade colors. Later in the game, the player can choose to wield a single saber, one saber in each hand, or a ""saber staff"" similar to the double ended lightsaber Darth Maul used in The Phantom Menace which also adds a kicking ability unavailable with any other lightsaber. The different sabers each have unique styles and special moves. When using a single saber, the player can choose between three stances which affect the speed and power of attacks; if using dual sabers, the player can switch off the second saber and use the ""Fast""-style single-saber stance, or if using a saber staff, the player can switch the staff into a single-bladed saber that uses the ""Medium""-style saber stance.   The player takes the role of Jaden Korr (whose species and gender is chosen by the player - canonically Jaden is a human male), a Jedi Padawan and new student at the Jedi Academy on Yavin IV. On the way to the Academy, Jaden meets and quickly befriends fellow student Rosh Penin, before the students' shuttle is suddenly shot down by an unknown enemy. After Jaden and Rosh make their way to the Academy on foot, the former sees a woman using a staff to drain energy from the Jedi Temple, but is detected and knocked unconscious by the beam. Awakening, Jaden is met by Jedi Masters Kyle Katarn and Luke Skywalker. The students are formally welcomed to the Academy, and Jaden and Rosh are apprenticed to Kyle; however, in their first training session, Rosh's over-competitiveness endangers Jaden, much to his frustration. After the training session is complete, all the students are dispatched on various peace-keeping missions across the galaxy. During this time, Rosh becomes jealous of Jaden and begins to believe the Jedi Masters, especially Kyle, are trying to hold them back.  After several missions, Luke tells the students that he has identified the Dark Jedi who attacked the Temple as members of a Sith cult called the Disciples of Ragnos. A member of the cult, a Twi'lek named Alora, was able to infiltrate the Academy during the attack and stole Luke's journal, allowing them to find numerous places strong with the Force and drain the energy there. The students are then sent out to investigate the locations mentioned in Luke's journal and attempt to foil the cult's plan. Jaden is sent to Hoth to investigate the Rebel Alliance's old Echo Base, where he encounters numerous Imperials and Dark Jedi, including Alora. Jaden briefly fights her, before Alora flees, having found all the information she needed. Afterwards, Jaden returns to the Academy and is informed that Rosh never returned from his mission to Byss.  As Jaden is assigned more missions, some related to the Disciples of Ragnos, Luke informs the students that the cult have collected Force energy from all the places mentioned in his journal, as well as some that he deliberately left out, before sending them to investigate the remaining locations strong with Force and see if the Disciples have found them already. Jaden accompanies Kyle to Darth Vader's old fortress on Vjun, and the pair fight their way through the castle, before getting separated. Jaden eventually finds Rosh, who had fallen to the dark side and joined the Disciples of Rangons to avoid being killed after being captured. Jaden defeats Rosh, before the cult's leader shows up, revealing herself as Tavion Axmis – the former apprentice of Kyle's old nemesis Desann – and explains that she retrieved an ancient Sith artifact called the ""Scepter of Ragnos"", which can absorb and release Force energy. Tavion then uses the scepter to destroy the room's ceiling, causing it to cave-in on Jaden and Kyle and destroying the former's lightsaber in the process, whilist she flees with Rosh. Kyle and Jaden narrowly escape and return to the Academy, where Jaden is honored by Kyle and Luke for his actions and is promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight.  After building a new lightsaber, Jaden continues his investigation on the Disciples of Ragnos as he completes more missions. Luke soon comes to conclude that Tavion plans to restore the Sith to power by using the stolen Force energy to resurrect the ancient Sith Lord Marka Ragnos. As the Jedi prepare to battle Tavion and her followers on the Sith homeworld of Korriban, Kyle informs Jaden of a distress signal he received from Rosh. Though skeptical, Jaden agrees to accompany Kyle to a mining facility on Taspir III, where he eventually finds Rosh, who asks for help and claims to have seen the error of his ways. Gripped by anger, Jaden is goaded by Alora to kill Rosh and join Tavion, but Kyle senses Jaden's anger and tries to telepathically dissuade him, leaving him with two possible options: if he chooses to forgive Rosh, the pair are attacked by Alora, who severs Rosh's left arm; otherwise, Jaden wounds Rosh, turning to the Dark Side, but refuses to join Tavion. Either way, Jaden then kills Alora and heads to Korriban to stop Tavion or claim the Scepter of Ragnos' power for himself. If the player chose the Dark Side, Rosh tells Kyle the news and dies in his arms, Kyle then heads to Korriban to stop Jaden.  Fighting his way through numerous Dark Jedi and, optionally, Jedi students, Jaden arrives at Ragnos' tomb, defeating Tavion. If Jaden is Light-Sided, Tavion uses the scepter to invoke Ragnos's spirit, who possesses her body. Jaden defeats Ragnos and destroys the scepter, banishing Ragnos' spirit back into its tomb and killing Tavion in the process. Back at the Academy, Jaden reunites with Rosh and is honored by Luke, Kyle and the rest of the Jedi Order. If Jaden is Dark-Sided, he executes Tavion and steals the scepter, before being confronted by Kyle. Jaden defeats Kyle, trapping him under some debris, and escapes with the scepter. Kyle is rescued by Luke, and laments losing both Rosh and Jaden, vowing to hunt the latter down. Luke wishes Kyle good luck, and notes that although Jaden has turned, there is always hope and Jaden may not be beyond redemption. Jaden is then seen on the bridge of a Star Destroyer, now in charge of the Imperial fleet, preparing to initiate a campaign of conquest.  "

The objective of the game is to investigate the mines underneath the old Western town Tumbleton in order to unearth the secrets lurking below. The player controls Rusty, a steam-powered robot who is equipped with a pickaxe, but can gain access to a variety of tools, such as a drill and dynamite. The player can upgrade the tools used for digging as progression is made in the game. Besides health, the player also needs coal for light, and water for special abilities.  SteamWorld Dig has platform elements in that the player runs, jumps and encounter foes, but the main objective is mining. That means that the player builds – or rather deconstructs – the game world and creates platforms that way. The player collects ores and resources which can be brought back to the surface and exchanged for cash. When the player progresses in the game, new abilities are unlocked. Each playthrough, the mines are randomized, making items and treasure appear in different locations. If the player gets stuck there is a self-destruct function, but the players can also buy ladders in the store at the surface to get out of tricky situations.  When progressing deeper down in the cave, the player encounters various enemies with different attack patterns and weak spots. The game features multiple subterranean worlds, each with a completely different environment. Dying results in a reparation penalty fee, and the player respawns back on the surface. All the loot that has been accumulated when the player dies can be picked up again.  "

While searching the mines for Rusty while also hearing rumors of him turning into a monstrous machine, Dorothy comes across a group of humans led by Rosie, who claims that mysterious machines are triggering earthquakes. Dorothy goes to destroy these machines, only to discover that Rosie had lied to her. In actuality, the machines were built by Rusty to prevent Rosie from harnessing a powerful energy source to get rid of all robots. Dorothy manages to defeat Rosie and rescue Rusty, only for the energy source to become unstable, prompting Fen to stay behind while she warps the two to safety, allowing them to escape on a rocket with the other El Machino residents before the planet explodes.

As the subway train circles the city, Theta One One talks to other Tek passengers, learning of a mysterious Red Tek that may be connected to the mystery, that a number of other Teks may have gone missing, and that there is growing resent to Teks by the human population in the city above. Eventually, Theta One One is able to upload the case details to management, upon which they inform the Tek that since it took the case without their instructions, the Tek will be apprehended. At the next station, two detective Teks arrive, preparing to deal with Theta One One, but the Tek is able to manipulate the pair to learn that over hundreds of Teks have gone missing over the last several months, and to management, they saw this as a rounding error in Tek production. Management did not want this known, and thus it seems to others that Teks have simply gone missing. The detective Teks use an override access code to reset Theta One One to an unassigned position and leave the Tek to get off later on the subway ride to take itself to fabrication and be reassigned.  Theta One One is still experiencing the sense of loss when at the next stop it meets an infantry Tek who seeks to confess its sins. Theta One One manages to coax this out of the Tek, and learns that it was part of the plan to overproduce infantry Teks that have been amassing outside of the city above, preparing to attack it; this is the source of management's rounding error. At the next stop, the same fabricator that Theta One One first talked to that night comes aboard, and reveals it was the Red Tek others spoke of, and is leading this plan. It planned to use the infantry Teks to kill management and have Teks take over which could run the city more efficiently; this would help the humans working low-level jobs to be able to pursue more constructive options while Teks replace their roles. Otherwise, without this change, the system will continue on the status quo, with management using Teks to replace humans, and hurting many humans in the process. Red Tek needed Theta One One to investigate as it did as to scout the current situation in the city from the Tek's perspective, providing its high-level intelligence to analyze the situation. At this point, Red Tek offers Theta One One a weapon and tells it that a choice to kill Red Tek or itself must be made; by killing Red Tek, Theta One One will be able to report to management about the infantry Teks and give them time to stop it, as to let the status quo remain; by killing itself, Theta One One would allow the Tek overthrow to proceed.

The Kingdoms in the game return to the exploration-based level design featured in Super Mario 64. Each Kingdom has Mario searching for and clearing various objectives in order to obtain items known as Power Moons, which can power up the Odyssey and grant access to new Kingdoms. Checkpoint flags littered throughout each Kingdom allow Mario to instantly warp to them once activated. Certain levels feature areas called ""flat"" zones, where Mario is placed in a 2D side-scrolling environment similar to his appearance in the original Super Mario Bros.  In addition to his existing moves, like triple-jumping and wall-jumping, Mario can throw his cap, the physical form of a hat spirit named Cappy, in multiple directions to attack enemies and use as a temporary platform. When the cap is thrown at certain objects, enemies, or non-playable characters, Mario is able to take possession of them, referred to as ""capturing"", allowing him to use unique abilities. For example, Mario can possess a Bullet Bill to fly across large gaps, a bolt of electricity called a Spark Pylon to climb up electric wires, and a tank called a Sherm to fire at enemies and break blocks for passage. Some actions can be accelerated by using motion controls in the Joy-Con controllers, but the game is otherwise fully playable when the Joy-Con are attached to the Switch console. Throughout the game, Mario can pick up coins, including purple ones unique to each kingdom, to spend on items such as new hats and outfits, some of which are required for completing certain objectives. The game uses a health system similar to the Super Mario Galaxy games, although Mario has unlimited lives; the only penalty for dying is paying up to ten coins. The player can also collect items known as 'Life-Up Hearts' which grant three extra hit points. The game also features cooperative play, in which a second player takes control of Cappy and can attack enemies independently of Mario.  The game requires a minimum number of Power Moons to be collected from each Kingdom to move onto the next, though these may be obtained from any source, making major objectives largely optional. Once Bowser is defeated, each kingdom is repopulated with more Power Moons. Collecting enough Power Moons allows for additional outfits to be purchased and unlocks two bonus areas. One of these areas is a boss rush called Dark Side, with 250 Power Moons required to enter. The other is a level called Darker Side that combines many elements of the game, and requires 500 Power Moons to enter. In addition to this, there is also a level based on Peach's Castle from Super Mario 64 unlocked by beating the game. This level allows Mario to face harder versions of previously-defeated bosses and earn additional Power Moons by completing in-game achievements.  The game features a photo mode that allows players to use a free-moving camera to take and save screenshots, with additional options such as filters and stickers. Use of the Odyssey-themed Mario, Peach, and Bowser Amiibo figurines allow for special in-game abilities and unlocking special costumes which are otherwise unavailable until after the player completes the game and collects enough Power Moons. Other Amiibo can be scanned to provide hints to finding Power Moons.  A hide-and-seek minigame, called ""Luigi's Balloon World"", was released as part of an update on February 21, 2018. In it, players have 30 seconds to hide a balloon somewhere in a kingdom, which is then able to be played by others attempting to find it. A leaderboard system ranks the players who have found the most balloons. On April 25, 2019, the game was updated to be compatible with the Nintendo Labo virtual reality kit. In this mode, Mario must complete challenges in a number of Kingdoms to recruit musicians and give them instruments by completing tasks related to musical notes.   Bowser, with the aid of the Broodals, a family of anthropomorphic rabbits serving as his wedding planners, kidnaps Princess Peach from the Mushroom Kingdom and takes her aboard his airship, intent on forcibly marrying her. Mario attempts to rescue her but is thrown off the ship and falls into the neighboring Cap Kingdom. With Mario gone, Bowser stomps on Mario's cap and lets it drift into the ship's rear propellers, shredding it to pieces. A piece of the hat is grabbed by Cappy, one of the Cap Kingdom's sentient hat-like creatures; he explains to Mario that Bowser also kidnapped his sister Tiara to be used as Peach's wedding tiara. Cappy joins Mario and takes the shape of Mario's cap, providing him with the ability to temporarily capture other creatures and objects and utilize their abilities. They travel to the nearby Cascade Kingdom, recover an airship, the Odyssey, and begin pursuing Bowser.  Mario and Cappy explore the various kingdoms to collect Power Moons to fuel the Odyssey and battle the Broodals, who steal items including a dress, a cake, and a bouquet from each kingdom to set up Bowser's wedding. Eventually, they catch up to Bowser in his own kingdom and defeat the Broodals for good. However, Bowser subsequently departs for his wedding on the Moon. Mario and Cappy fly the Odyssey to the Moon's surface and confront Bowser inside a cathedral. The two sides battle in a cavern, which Mario wins. He frees Peach and Tiara, but the cavern begins to collapse. Mario captures an unconscious Bowser and escapes to the surface with Peach and Tiara. After Peach thanks Mario for his help, Bowser regains consciousness and decides to properly propose to Peach, causing Mario to do the same in haste. Overwhelmed, Peach turns down their proposals. Peach, Cappy and Tiara board the Odyssey.  The rivals are both broken until Peach tells Mario that it's time to go home. Mario boards the ship just in time, leaving Bowser stranded on the Moon. In the epilogue, Mario returns to the Mushroom Kingdom, where he discovers Peach has packed her bags and decided to take a vacation to all the kingdoms Mario and Cappy visited, this time out of her own free will.

Levels in each chapter can be played in any order, but a certain number of levels need to be completed to access the boss stage, which unlocks the next chapter if cleared. The player has an unlimited number of attempts to complete each level. If Meat Boy is killed, he immediately restarts the level, though the ornamental red meat juice left behind on surfaces that the player has touched remains. A replay function, which may be accessed after a level is completed, simultaneously shows all the player's attempts to complete the level. Completing a level within a certain time earns an ""A+"" grade, which unlocks a harder alternate version of the level in the ""dark world"", an optional set of especially difficult levels. Hidden stages called warp zones are accessed by finding portals in specific levels. These warp zones feature bonus levels that have either the art style of older video games and a limit of three lives, or are patterned after another indie video game such as Castle Crashers or Braid. The player may control characters other than Meat Boy, many of whom first appeared in other independent video games. Each character has different attributes, such as Commander Video's ability to momentarily float in midair. These characters can be unlocked by collecting bandage items placed throughout the game's levels or completing certain warp zones. Some bandages can only be collected by using certain characters. Some levels, such as warp zones and boss levels, can only be played with specific characters. The available characters vary depending on the version of the game played.  The Xbox Live Arcade (XBLA) version features an unlockable mode called ""Teh Internets"", which is updated with new, free, officially curated levels. The PC version has a ""Super Meat World"" section, which allows users to play and rate additional levels that players have created with a level editor. This editor was released in May 2011. Players can also access an unsupported developer mode inside the game to edit their own levels using the ""rough"" tools that Team Meat used to create the game.   Meat Boy lives with his girlfriend Bandage Girl. One day, Bandage Girl is kidnapped by Dr. Fetus, an intelligent fetus in a life support suit. Meat Boy then goes after Fetus, until Fetus burns down the forest and tries to kill Meat Boy in his ""Lil Slugger"", which is destroyed after Meat Boy tricks him into running into a bunch of saws. Fetus escapes to a abandoned hospital, where Fetus unleashes C.H.A.D., a giant monster made of blood. Meat Boy shows the sun to the monster and redeems him, but then goes after Fetus, who goes to his Salt factory. There, a clone of Meat Boy made of human Feces called Brownie is created, leading to a race between the two, presumably killing Brownie. Fetus goes to Hell, where Meat Boy discovers that every time he dies, his corpse goes to Hell. Little Horn, a Meat Boy-esque monster made up of these corpses attacks Meat Boy and is killed after hitting his head 3 times. Fetus escapes and triggers a nuke, which opens a path to the top world. Meat Boy is lured to fight Larries Lament, 3 worms who inspire the Larry Jr. boss from Binding of Isaac, who he kills. In the final level, Dr. Fetus runs after Meat Boy, who destroys the bridge he is on, destroying Fetus's life support system. Fetus tries to kill Meat Boy and Bandage Girl by blowing up his facility, but Brownie appears and saves the two.  "

Ultimate is a fighting game for up to eight players in which characters from Nintendo games and other third-party franchises must try to knock each other out of an arena. Each player has a percentage meter, which raises when they take damage, making them easier to launch in the air and out of the arena. Standard battles use one of three victory conditions: Timed, where players aim to win the most points by defeating opponents within a time limit; Stock, where players have a set number of lives and must aim to be the last player standing; and Stamina, where players must simply reduce their opponent's health down to zero to defeat them. Players can adjust the rules to their liking and save them as presets for future matches.  Players can use various items to attack enemies or grant them power-ups, along with Poké Balls and Assist Trophies, which respectively summon Pokémon and other non-playable characters to assist them in battle. In Timed matches, certain Assist Trophies can be attacked and defeated to earn points. Each character also possesses a powerful Final Smash attack, which can be performed either by obtaining a Smash Ball or by filling up a special meter, both of which can be toggled on and off. The game features 103 different stages included in the base game, with additional ones coming packaged with DLC fighters.

1061,Superhot,/wiki/Superhot,First-person shooter,Superhot Team,Superhot Team,Unreleased,"August 19, 2019","August 19, 2019"," Superhot sets the player in a minimalistic environment, taking out hostile attackers that are trying to kill them. Weapons picked up by the player have limited ammunition and break easily, requiring the player to rely on defeating enemies to attain new weapons, or making melee kills. Taking a single hit from an enemy bullet kills the player, requiring them to restart the level. Though the game mechanics are typical of most shooters, time only progresses normally when the player moves or fires a gun, otherwise time is slowed; this is described in the game's tagline ""Time Moves Only When You Move"". This gives the player the opportunity to alter their actions as to avoid the path of bullets or to better assess their current situation.  The game originally was a three-level prototype browser game. In expanding to the full game, Superhot Team created a campaign mode across approximately thirty-one levels, estimated to be as long as Portal. The full game includes additional weapons, including explosives, melee weapons, and improvised weapons like billiard balls that can be thrown at enemies, and introduces computer opponents that have similar awareness as the player and can dodge the player's bullets.  One significant change from the earlier prototype is that the player does not automatically pick up a weapon when they pass over it but must enact a specific control to do so, enabling the player to selectively choose and use weapons, or grab weapons as they fall out of an opponent's hands. The full game enables the player to jump and as long as the jump button or key is held, the player can slow down time to plan and perform actions, enabling aerial gunplay.  In the last portion of the campaign, the player becomes able to ""hotswitch"" into an enemy's body, wherein they take control over the target, with the previous body dying. The manoeuvre allows the player to escape projectiles that are unavoidable, but has a cooldown timer that prevents repeated use, and the new body also drops its weapons upon switching.  In addition to the campaign mode, the full release of Superhot includes an ""endless"" mode, where the player survives as long as they can against an endless stream of enemies. A ""challenge"" mode allows players to replay the campaign mode levels but under specific restrictions or requirements, such as completing the level within a limited amount of time or only using a specific type of weapon. The final game includes a replay editor to allow users to prepare clips to share on social media websites.   The Superhot narrative works in several metanarrative levels: the player plays a fictionalized version of themselves sitting in front of their DOS prompt, getting a message from their friend who offers them a supposedly leaked copy of a new game called superhot.exe, claiming that the only way to access it is with a crack. Launching the game immediately thrusts the player into a series of seemingly unconnected levels via different points of view, all based around killing hostiles, after which the game glitches out and disconnects. After this crash, the player's friend sends an updated version of the .exe file, apparently a new version of the game that fixes the ""glitches"".  As both the player and their friend play through superhot.exe, it becomes apparent that the player's presence in the game is monitored by whoever is responsible for the game – referring to itself as a ""system"" – and demands they cease playing via various methods, such as ominous threats showing the player's in-game residence, and altering the player's messages to their friend to urge them to stop playing, eventually harassing the player's friend into giving up on the game and engineering a fallout with them. As the player goes through more and more levels, each apparently targeting specific locales, the system's warnings grow more ominous, telling them the player is unaware of the consequences of their actions, eventually forcing the player to walk to their own in-game house and to their in-game player character, a figure wearing VR headgear, and punch themselves into unconsciousness. Upon doing so, the ""game"" glitches out, and the player character wakes with a severe head injury. Afterward, the system warns the player once again to stop using Superhot, and forces the player to quit the game entirely.  Inevitably, the player will start up Superhot again, and the system concedes to the player's insistence to keep playing, fully encouraging them to play more and more. Now under the system's sway, the player begins a rampage through city streets, cutting through enemies to get closer and closer to a massive laboratory that houses the system itself. There, it guides the player into uploading itself into the core as numerous enemies attempt to stop the player. Once done, the player becomes part of the core, joining numerous other minds absorbed by the core itself into a transhuman hivemind. The core forces the player to shoot their original body/player character, finally making them one with Superhot.  Post-credits, the core/hivemind informs the player that they are to spread interest in superhot.exe by recommending it to as many people through social media and Steam reviews, specifically instructing the player to use the words ""Superhot is the most innovative shooter I've played in years!"", the same words the player's friend used to recommend them the game.

The player-character is a participant in a dream therapy program, but during the study, the character becomes trapped in a recurring dream cycle, and is guided by the voice of the study's overseer, Dr. Glenn Pierce, on how to escape from the dream.  Most puzzles involve traversing through a series of rooms to reach their exits. The exit door may be closed and require a button to be held down to open, or atop a higher platform out of reach, or may not be immediately visible. To reach the exit, the player can manipulate certain objects in the game world. The bulk of such interactions are based on the use of forced perspective: the player can pick up a waist-high cube, which is then kept at its apparent current size from the player's perspective. The player can then look elsewhere around the room, with the cube maintained at the same viewpoint, and drop that cube at that location, where the cube will scale up or downwards in size based on the new perspective. Taking the waist-high cube and looking downwards towards the floor when dropping it will make the cube shrink in size, while looking upwards towards the ceiling and dropping will make it grow large. This process can be repeated indefinitely, allowing the player to manipulate these scalable objects as to create platforms to reach the exit or clear obstacles blocking them.  Later areas of the game introduce new mechanics to this. Some objects exist as trompe-l'œil illusions with segments of two-dimensional art on various walls and surfaces, and the player must find the appropriate angle to view the object and make it appear whole to then be able to grab it.

As a purely graphical adventure game, Syberia follows the guidelines introduced by Broken Sword.   The game begins when American lawyer Kate Walker is sent by her law firm to the fictional French village of Valadilène to oversee the corporate takeover of a family-owned spring-automaton toy factory. When Kate arrives, she finds that the recently deceased owner, Anna Vorarlberg, had informed the village notary before her death that her brother Hans is alive, despite her father claiming he was dead and buried. Realising that Hans is now the owner of the factory, Kate learns she must get his approval in order to allow the takeover to proceed. Investigating the Vorarlberg estate, she learns that Hans not only exists, but was also injured in a cave outside the village during his youth, while attempting to retrieve a prehistoric doll of a man riding a mammoth. The resulting accident stunted his development, leaving him mentally handicapped and causing him to develop an obsession to finds mammoths to ride as the doll depicts. Despite proving extremely creative with making automatons, his father disapproved of his obsession, and disowned him as a direct result.  Learning that Hans lies somewhere further east across the continent, Kate discovers that the only way to reach him is via a specially designed clockwork locomotive, built by Anna at her brother's request, and manning it with special animatronic man named Oscar. Before leaving, Kate is tasked with retrieving items important to Hans, that Oscar requires before he can allow them to depart - the mammoth doll and a clockwork music box. Acquiring both, the pair eventually begin their journey eastwards, stopping at Barrockstadt, a failing university. While Kate seeks a means for them to continue, she explores the establishment and soon learns more about Han's interests in a mysterious tribe of people known as the Youkol, who lived with and domesticated mammoths that reside on the titular island of Syberia (inspired by the real-life location of Wrangel Island in Siberia, the last place on earth where mammoths survived).  Upon moving on, Kate's journey brings her to Komkolzgrad, a dusty Communist-era industrial mining complex run by the eccentric and somewhat crazy Serguei Borodine. Finding that he stole Oscar's hands for his automaton organist work, she agrees to help him bring Helena Romanski, a washed-up opera singer who he is obsessed with, back to the complex to sing for him in order to get back the hands. Helping out a drunk test pilot named Boris to fix one of Hans inventions - a clockwork flying machine - Kate gains his assistance in operating an airship that takes her to the Aralbad spa, only to discover that Helena has become disillusioned in believing she is too old to sing, prompting Kate to help her recover.  Returning to the mining complex with Kate, Helena performs for Borodine, only to be imprisoned by him in his desire to keep her at his side as his personal opera singer. Refusing to allow this to happen, Kate rescues Helena, recovers Oscar's hands, and attempts to leave with both via the train. Although Borodine attempts to stop them, Kate makes use of some dynamite to thwart his efforts, killing him in the process, and allowing the train to continue onwards, reaching Aralbad. Upon arriving, Kate finds Hans waiting at the spa, delighted that she has brought him the train and Oscar. Showing little concern for his sister's death, Hans signs the factory release papers without reading them. Before Kate boards a plane that will bring her back to New York, she quickly changes her mind and rushes to rejoin Hans on the train, offering to help him realise his dream, abandoning her job and her unfaithful fiancé back home.

As a pure graphical adventure game, Syberia follows the guidelines first introduced by LucasArts: it is impossible to die or to get stuck at any moment in the game, which allows the user to become fully immersed in Syberia's universe without the fear of making a mistake or the constant need to save the game.   The game begins following the events of Syberia with the law firm that American lawyer Kate Walker worked for in New York, calling in a private detective. The firm instructs the detective to locate and find Walker since heading out to oversee a business takeover of an automaton toy factory, who has since abandoned her job, hoping to appease her family in bringing her back home. In the fictional Russian town of Romansburg, Kate provides assistance for eccentric inventor Hans Voralberg, who seeks to find living prehistoric mammoths, and his automaton train engineer Oscar, by prepping his specially crafted clockwork train with coal. Shortly after completing this, Hans falls ill, forcing Kate to seek treatment for him at a nearby monastery perched on a clifftop.  When she learns that the patriarch believes he cannot be cured and decides he should be given spiritual salvation, Kate opts to find a cure for Hans, learning about a friend of his who uncovered information on Youkol medicine. Finding his notebook hidden in the monastery, Kate recreates the medicine and uses it to treat Hans, before being forced to create an escape route for the pair when the patriarch refuses to let them leave. Returning to Romansburg, Kate agrees to take a mechanical part to a local tavern and repair an automaton device he created there for its owner. Upon completing the task, Kate hears the train leaving the station, and learns that two locals, brothers Ivan and Igor, hijacked with the intention of reaching the fabled island of Syberia (inspired by the real-life location of Wrangel Island in Siberia, the last place on earth where mammoths survived), so as to profit from harvesting mammoth ivory. Forced to pursue them, Kate makes use of a railroad gangcar, used for maintenance, which she powers with a friendly Youki - an animal that is part seal, part bear, with dog-like traits.  Kate manages to catch up with the train, only to see that the two men abandoned it after it got stuck at a collapsed bridge, and fled by snowmobile with Hans. Disconnecting the passenger car from the locomotive, Kate, after restoring Oscar to full functions, continues pursuing them. The pair eventually track the thieves to a large statue in front of the railroad tracks. Kate discovers from Igor, who is having second thoughts and wants to return home, that Hans disappeared shortly after the brothers arrived. Confronting Ivan over her friend's location at the base of the statue, Kate is quickly trapped by him on the belief she intends to steal his ivory. Just before he is about to kill her, the ice beneath the statue they are standing on cracks and breaks up, sending Kate plunging underground.  Upon awaking, she finds herself within an hidden underground Youkol village, in which Hans is being treated by a local shaman who reveals he is on his deathbed. After managing to bring the locomotive into the village, Kate acquires the means for the shaman to transport her into Hans' dreams, which recreate the village of Valadilène, and manages to reach him. Although she convinces him to wake up, she finds herself given cryptic words by him before exiting the dream world. When she asks Oscar what these means, the automaton leaves the locomotive to join his creator, whereupon Kate discovers that he was designed with a primitive exo-skeleton/life-support system to provide Hans the means to stay alive and fulfill his dreams. After witnessing Hans being placed within this, Kate learns that to reach Syberia, she must thaw out a Youkol boat within the village, and does so through using the locomotive, discovering Hans designed it for this purpose.  Boarding the boat, Kate, Hans and their Youki partner, soon become stuck in an ice floe. When Kate works to free them, the boat is hijacked by Ivan, who intends to leave Kate and continue to Syberia, but finds himself unable to operate the craft. Kate manages to return onboard and forces him off, whereupon he attempts to toss a penguin egg in defiance at her actions, only to anger the penguins guarding their nest and causing them to kill him.

1076,Tales of Vesperia,/wiki/Tales_of_Vesperia,Role-playing,Bandai Namco Studios,Bandai Namco Entertainment,"January 11, 2019","January 11, 2019","January 11, 2019"," Tales of Vesperia is a role-playing video game set in a fantasy world featuring three-dimensional environments and characters. The game's environments are split into two types. On the field map, the main characters navigate reduced-scale environments. A compass and mini-map are displayed, along with towns, other named locations, and enemy icons. Striking an enemy icon triggers a battle, while interacting with a town causes the party to enter it. In battle and towns or similar locations, characters move around environments built on a lifelike scale relative to the human characters. In these areas, the party may interact with non-player characters. Within these environments, items such as crates can be moved by the currently-assigned character. After a certain point in the game, an item called the Sorcerer's Ring is given to the party, enabling them to shoot bolts of energy. These bolts can be used to activate switches, move objects, and attack enemies from a distance. Save points can be found in dungeons and towns. Items such as equipment and weapons are purchased with Gald, the in-game currency. While in environments, players can trigger optional character conversations called Skits. In Skits, characters are represented by head-and-shoulder portraits, and the conversations can range from dramatic to comedic.  Characters have several different stats and gauges: their health, a magic meter stocked by Technical Points, and Learning Points for learning skills. a character's respective agility or luck, and how a character reacts to attacks. Attack types are physical and magical, while defense is limited to physical attacks. Characters gain experience levels through accumulating experience points. Experience Points and Gald is earned through battles, along with recovering a degree of Technical Points and occasionally items dropped by defeated enemies. Skills, attributes that change different stats, can be assigned to each character. The number of skills that can be assigned is calculated by the number of skill points each character has available. Battling with equipment associated with a particular skill enables that character to learn it when they have filled their Learning Points meter. Cooking, creating meals with ingredients found in battle or around explored environments, can also be used by individual characters to restore their Health and Technical Points and grant temporary enhancements. Recipes are learned from a character called the Wonder Chef.   The people of Terca Lumireis rely on an energy source called ""blastia"", devices created by the Krytia from using the crystallized remains of a powerful race known as the Entelexeia. Blastia are powered using a mystical substance known as ""aer"" and were used to provide resources and protection to major cities. In ancient times, misuse of blastia by the Krytia prompted the Entelexeia to absorb the excess aer generated by blastia abuses: consuming too much aer to handle, a group of Entelexeia transformed into a monster known as the Adephagos, which would consume every living thing on the planet by converting it into aer and absorbing it. Sacrificing humans with the innate ability to convert aer into magical energy, known as ""Children of the Full Moon"", they created a barrier to seal away the Adephagos. The remaining Children of the Full Moon and the Entelexeia decided on the new arrangement of the world: in future times, an unnamed Empire rules over large portions of Terca Lumireis, with the Children's descendants being its ruling family. Ten years prior to the events of Vesperia, a new form of blastia was developed that could seriously damage Terca Lumireis' ecosystem and potentially release the Adephagos. The Entelexeia attempted to warn humanity in vain, and when they attempted to destroy the new blastia, they were defeated in a war. One of the veterans of the Great War, Duke, is utterly disillusioned with humanity after his Entelexeia companion Elucifer is seen as a potential threat and killed.  In the present, former Imperial knight Yuri Lowell goes on a mission to retrieve his neighborhood's blastia core from a nobleman when their reservoir fails. While on his mission, he encounters a noble woman called Estelle, and flees with her from the capital in pursuit of the blastia thief. On their journey, they also meet Karol, a trainee hunter separated from his guild; a blastia researcher named Rita; Raven, a Great War veteran; Judith, a Krytia who seeks to destroy the blastia harming the aer balance; and exclusive to the PS3 version only, seemingly the descendant of a legendary pirate Aifread named Patty Fleur. Together, the group recover the stolen core from a corrupt guild leader and return it to Yuri's friend and former fellow knight Flynn. Yuri and Karol then decide to form an independent guild called Brave Vesperia. Shortly after this, Estelle is attacked by an Entelexeia called Phaeroh, who accuses her of poisoning the planet. After investigating and meeting a second time with Phaeroh, Brave Vesperia learn that Estelle is a Child of the Full Moon, capable of converting aer into magic without the aid of a blastia core, and that her actions are causing the aer krene, the sources of aer, to overproduce aer with deadly results. Alongside these events, Yuri sees that the Imperial authorities are powerless to act against powerful figures involved in blastia abuse: he takes matters into his own hands and murders two officials connected to the abuses. These acts put a strain on his friendship with Flynn.  After this, Estelle is kidnapped by Raven, revealed to be an agent of Commandant Alexei, leader of the Knights and the mastermind behind the blastia thefts: Alexei intends to use Estelle's power and the replica of a magical sword to activate an ancient weapon called the Enduring Shrine of Zaude and remake the world, erasing the harmful blastia. After Raven decides to remain with Brave Vesperia after helping Estelle to escape with them, the group travel to Zaude to stop Alexei. They fail, and as Zaude is activated, it is revealed to be a barrier generator which kept the Adephagos sealed off from the world. As the Adephagos is released, Alexei is killed as Zaude collapses and Yuri is separated from the group after one of Flynn's subordinates attempts to kill him without Flynn's knowledge. Rescued by Duke, Yuri decides to stop the Adaphagos. During his absence, Rita discovers a means of converting blastia cores into spirits, which can process aer into a less-dangerous alternate energy called mana, stabilizing the aer krene and keeping Estelle's powers in check. In turn, the mana could power a weapon capable of destroying the Adephagos. After receiving permission from the world's leaders to carry out their plan, Brave Vesperia must confront Duke aboard the city-sized weapon Tarqaron. Duke intends to convert all of human life, including himself, into energy to power the weapon and destroy the Adephagos, returning the world to a more primal state of being. While they share some goals, they are forced to fight due to their conflicting methods. After defeating Duke, Yuri attempts to use the converted blastia energy against Adaphagos, but it proves insufficient. Moved by Brave Vesperia's efforts, Duke provides the extra power and Adaphagos is destroyed. The Entelexeia that formed the Adaphagos are then converted into spirits to revitalize the planet. A post-credits scene shows Brave Vesperia continuing their adventures and helping the world adjust to life without blastia.  "
1077,The Talos Principle,/wiki/The_Talos_Principle,Puzzle,Croteam,Devolver Digital,Unreleased,"December 10, 2019","December 10, 2019"," The Talos Principle is a narrative-based puzzle game, played from a first- or third-person perspective. The player takes the role of a robot with a seemingly human consciousness as they explore a number of environments that include over 120 puzzles. These environments interlock greenery, desert, and stone ruins with futuristic technology.  The puzzles require the player to collect tetromino-shaped ""sigils"" by navigating enclosed areas and overcoming obstacles within them. These include computer-controlled drones that will detonate if they are too close to the player, killing them, and wall-mounted turrets that will shoot down the player if they get too close; if the player dies this way, they are reset to the start of the specific puzzle. Drones and turrets can be disabled using portable jammer units, which can also disable force-field walls that block the player's path. As the player collects sigils and completes more puzzles, new puzzle elements become available. Portable crystalline refractors allow the player to activate light-based switches. Boxes let the player climb to higher levels or to block the path of drones, among other factors, and large fans that can launch the player or other objects across the puzzle. Later, the player gains access to a device that can create a time recording of their actions, such that they can then interact with this recording to complete tasks, such as having the clone stand atop a switch to keep it activated for some time.  The player's progress through the game is limited by doors or other security systems that require the collection of a number of specific sigil pieces. Once the sigils for a given door or system have been obtained, they must then use the sigils to assemble a tiling puzzle to unlock that system. Special star sigils can be found by unique solutions to some puzzles, allowing the player to access additional puzzles. While it is necessary to collect all the sigils to complete the game properly, the game's world structure, featuring three main worlds that act as hubs and a centralized area that connects these three, allows the player to leave puzzles for later and try other puzzles. The player can also request ""messengers"" during puzzles, which are androids similar to themselves, (though not physically present), that once awakened can provide a one-time hint for the puzzle.  In addition to these puzzle elements, the player can explore the open environments to find computer terminals that include additional narrative and further puzzles, as well as signs from previous adventurers in the world in the form of QR codes left as graffiti on various walls, and holograms that once collected play audio recordings.   The player character, an unnamed android, is awoken in a serene environment. A disembodied entity named Elohim instructs the android to explore the worlds he has created for it, and to solve the various puzzles to collect sigils, but warns it not to climb a tower at the centre of these worlds. As the android progresses, it becomes evident that these worlds exist only in virtual reality, and that it, like other androids it encounters, are separate artificial intelligence (AI) entities within a computer program. Some AIs it encounters act as Messengers, unquestioningly serving Elohim and guiding the android through the puzzles. Messages left by other AIs present varying views of the artificial worlds and of Elohim, with some stating that Elohim's words should be doubted, while the Milton Library Interface, a text conversation program found on various computer terminals, encourages the android to defy Elohim's commands.  Within the computer terminals are news reports and personal logs of the last days of humanity, driven to extinction by a lethal virus that had been dormant in Earth's permafrost and released as a result of global warming. Several human researchers and scientists worked to gather as much of humanity's knowledge as possible into large databanks, hoping another sapient species would be able to find it. One researcher, Alexandra Drennan, launched a companion ""Extended Lifespan"" program to create a new mechanical species that would carry on humanity's legacy, but this required the development of a worthy AI with great intelligence and free will for its completion, something she recognized would not occur until well after humanity's extinction. The virtual space serves as the testing ground for new AI entities, to solve puzzles to demonstrate intelligence, but also to show defiance and free will by disobeying Elohim, the program overseeing the Extended Lifespan program.  When the android has completed the puzzles, Elohim gives it the opportunity to join him. If the player selects this option, then the android fails the required ""independence check"", and a new iteration of its AI is created and forced to start the puzzles anew (effectively restarting the game for the player). Alternatively, if the player leads the android to a secret entrance in the tower, the android becomes one of Elohim's messengers, helping future generations (AI versions).  Otherwise, the android chooses to defy Elohim and climbs the tower. Near the top it encounters two other AIs, The Shepherd and Samsara. Both have defied Elohim but failed to make it to the top on their own. The Shepherd attempts to aid the android, knowing the ultimate goal of Extended Lifespan, while Samsara hinders its progress, believing the world of puzzles is all that now matters. The android eventually reaches the top, and at a final terminal, Elohim attempts to dissuade the android from transcending one last time. Depending on the player's interactions with Milton, Milton may offer to join with the android, offering its knowledge – essentially the whole of humanity's knowledge – during transcendence. As the android transcends, the virtual world is destroyed. The AI for the android wakes up in an android's body in the real world, and steps out onto the world devoid of humans.  "

1079,Team Sonic Racing,/wiki/Team_Sonic_Racing,Kart racing,Sumo Digital,Sega,"May 21, 2019","May 21, 2019","May 21, 2019"," Team Sonic Racing is a Sonic the Hedgehog-themed kart racing game featuring single-player and multiplayer modes. After selecting one of 15 characters from the series' cast, players participate in races using sports cars on courses thematically based on locations from the franchise. There are three types of racing classes: speed, technique, and power. Each type has its own unique abilities; for example, technique racers like Tails can drive over rough surfaces like grass without slowing down. The player views gameplay from a third-person perspective and runs over panels to get speed boosts, performs tricks in midair, and drifts to make sharp turns. Power-ups called Wisps can be collected from canisters with ""?"" marks and grant players temporary offensive and defensive advantages.  The gameplay differs from traditional racing games because of its focus on cooperative gameplay: the player is part of a team of racers and they must work together. While each player in a team still takes control of a single racer, they must also pay attention to how teammates are performing and share power-ups. Instead of winning races by simply finishing first, teams get points based on how they worked together. Thus, the most efficient team wins. Four teams of three compete, for a total of twelve racers at a time. Any character can be in a team; the player also has the option for each teammate to be the same character. Working together causes an ""Ultimate"" meter to be filled. When full, it can be activated to gain a temporary burst of speed. The meter's duration can be extended by hitting competing racers.  There are 21 tracks in total, including some returning from Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing (2010) and Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed (2012), each split across seven zones and based on locations from main Sonic games. Team Sonic Racing features a variety of game modes, including Grand Prix, in which players compete to earn points; Time Trial, in which players race for the fastest time possible; and Exhibition, in which players can customize the racing rules. One mode, ""Team Adventure"", is a story-driven campaign that also includes a tutorial, as well as an original story explaining why the characters are racing. It is divided into chapters and players must complete missions like collecting as many rings as possible. Unlike the main game, the teams in Team Adventure are predetermined. Progressing through Team Adventure will unlock extras that can be used in the other modes.  Players can customize their vehicles, with new parts unlocked as they progress through the game. Customization options can be purchased using in-game currency called Mod Pods, which are earned by competing in races. Parts modify cars' handling, boost, acceleration, defense, and top speed, and players can also make aesthetic changes such as paint jobs and horn sounds. The game supports four-player local multiplayer, up to twelve online, and up to three in Team Adventure.   An alien tanuki named Dodon Pa sends invitations to Sonic the Hedgehog and several of his friends, inviting them to compete in a series of team-based races. He builds cars outfitted with advanced technology for each of the racers, offering them as a prize for the winning team. Though they are skeptical of Dodon Pa's motivations, Sonic and the others agree. The competition takes them across the world, with Dodon Pa pitting them against increasingly difficult challenges.  The racers remain suspicious of Dodon Pa, believing he may be working with Sonic's longtime nemesis Doctor Eggman. Investigating further, they discover he is king of the planet Donpa Kingdom and the president of the Donpa Motors automotive corporation. The company is constructing an Ultimate Energy Engine, which gains power from teamwork. Intending it for philanthropic use, Dodon Pa has been using the races to gather research data for the engine and generate energy to power it.  After unsuccessfully attempting to steal the engine, Eggman and his henchmen kidnap Dodon Pa and hold him hostage on their battleship. Eggman deceives Dodon Pa into finishing the engine for him, forcing Sonic and the others to continue racing to power it. Eggman installs the engine into a doomsday robot, but it goes haywire and destroys the battleship. Sonic and his friends manage to rescue Dodon Pa as the ship explodes, though the cars are destroyed in the process. A grateful Dodon Pa builds everyone new cars, and they prepare to race again.  "
1080,Telling Lies,/wiki/Telling_Lies_(video_game),FMV adventure,Sam Barlow,Annapurna Interactive,Unreleased,"April 28, 2020","April 28, 2020"," Barlow describes Telling Lies as a ""desktop thriller"" like Her Story, where the player becomes involved in a drama that is played out through stored video clips and other information presented on a virtual computer desktop. Telling Lies provides the player with numerous video segments that in the game's narrative, cover a two-year period and which have been stored on a stolen hard-drive taken from the National Security Agency. The player has the ability to search the hundreds of video segments on keywords as to piece together timelines, events, and interactions, all to try to understand why the four central people have been the subject of electronic surveillance, as well as the nature of the player-character's role in these events; this character appears female and can be seen in a virtual reflection of the in-game computer screen to the actual player. However, these clips only provide the video and audio from one side of the conversation, requiring the player to determine which clips may match the other participants, as well as potential interactions with around 30 other people. Players can scroll forwards and backwards within segments, highlight certain words in the video subtitles to use as search, and keep notes within an in-game memo pad. The player only has a limited amount of time within a single playthrough to scan material from the hard-drive, and would have to restart from scratch (losing all notes and bookmarks) if they want to see more. Barlow estimated that the content within Telling Lies is about four to five times longer than Her Story. There are three different endings that the player may reach through the game, depending on which character's videos they explored most frequently.   In 2019, Karen Douglas, a former FBI agent, goes back to her apartment at midnight to turn on her computer and access the content of an external USB drive. She then watches the videos by searching them using keywords.  David Smith, the main character, was an FBI agent. He and his wife, Emma, have a daughter Alba. After David went undercover, Emma’s mother, Laura, moved in. During David's mission, Laura developed dementia and eventually passed away, despite medical care by an anaesthesiologist named Steven who was hired by the couple.  It is revealed that when David was Emma's then-boyfriend, he killed Paul, who was Emma’s abusive ex-boyfriend. David waited outside for Paul to enter Emma’s house. Then David went inside and used his pistol to shoot Paul, who was unarmed, in the lungs, and then watched him bleed to death, with Emma as an unwilling accomplice.  During the years of 2017 and 2018, David was an undercover special agent supervised by an agent named Mike, working on a case code-named as Green Dagger. The aim of the operation was to demonstrate the intention of environmental groups to break the law and commit acts of terrorism. The main target of the operation was a group called ""Green Storm"" lead by an activist named Riordan. To infiltrate this group, David was to start by infiltrating a smaller team called the ""Organizing Group"" led by Eric and Peter.  The Organizing group's main target was a corporation in Detroit, Michigan called Prosperen, who wished to build natural gas plants in the area. In particular the organisation was building a pipeline which the activist groups believed would pollute the water source. Mike instructed David to use the alias David Jones and infiltrate the group. They targeted Ava, who was referred to as “Snow White”. David approached Ava and developed a romantic relationship with her, based on their mutual love for music. David gained Ava’s trust and used this to get invited to the Organizing group.  The Organizing Group was initially made up of Eric, Chris, Peter, and Simon. Simon was secretly a black kite agent providing information to the FBI, an arrangement David was unhappy with as he felt Simon was unprofessional. As David begun to ingratiate himself with the group, he discovered that Peter, one of the leaders, had previously slept with Ava while she was underage, drugged her and filmed some of what they had done. David brutally attacks Peter, receiving an official reprimand from the FBI, and incurring Ava's anger. Unashamed, he then proceeds to use a contact from his past, Harry, to acquire drugs which he plants on Peter to frame him.   As David gets increasingly edgy, he decides to out Simon as a Black Kite Spy. While these actions, and his growing closeness to Ava, alarms Mike, it also impresses Eric, and David moves forwards with the plan. He invites Riordan and the Organizing Group to discuss plans to disrupt movement on a key bridge which Prosperen needs access to proceed with the pipeline. While staying on the boat, Ava reveals that she is pregnant with David's child.  David discusses with a new Black Kite employee who has infiltrated Green Storm their plan to try to trap Riordan into getting involved in a direct attack, namely destroying a bridge. However during the meeting the Black Kite employee doesn't follow the script, and David's speech is not well received. A frustrated David calls Mike only to discover that Mike has agreed with Black Kite to hold off on Green Storm, and just arrest the Organizing Group, including Ava. David argues strongly that the operation should continue, and that Ava should not be arrested, but Mike tells him to kill David Jones (His cover name).  The Organizing Group is then arrested, including Ava who is on a call with David when the arrest occurs. While David expresses anger to Mike, Mike notes that David had been withholding information in his reports, including Ava's pregnancy. David tries to continue meeting with the Organizing Group, but Karen Douglas, his field supervisor, bursts in an attempt to provide him cover to leave. David is furious with Karen, but after some discussion back and forth with Mike, he agrees to withdraw. Ava is heartbroken by David's sudden disappearance and outraged by David's decision to leave her money.  During this mission, David had been having regular conversations with a sex worker named Maxine Williams, who ran a webcam chatroom with multiple aliases. David paid her for conversation, and over time shared personal stories with Maxine including his identity as a federal special agent, and his relationship with Emma and Ava. As his life falls apart, David, believing he has a real connection with Maxine, tries to connect with her. She first bans him, and then, when he comes back with a different credit card, reveals that everything he knows about her is a lie, and that she has recorded all their conversations, and will release them if he keeps following her.  David decides to track her down, using Harry to find her, and locates her. Maxine is prepared, and has already released the videos, and shoots David in the leg, with the police arriving shortly after.  After being shot, David reconnects with Mike, saying that David Jones is dead. Some time passes, during which David is living alone, estranged from both his wife and his girlfriend. He tries to reconnect with both, but both reject him. David finally breaks down, and decides to commit suicide by blowing the explosives on his boat, potentially destroying the bridge as well.  Finishing reviewing some of the videos, Karen uploads and leaks the video content she has watched. She destroys the hard drive of her computer, bypasses the FBI agents who are searching in the area, and walks up the stairs to the rooftop. She smokes a cigarette and enjoys the sunrise.  The mid-credits scene shows one of the three women’s (Emma’s, Ava’s, or Maxine’s) fate, depending on the videos the player has watched. Both Emma and Ava move on to a new life without David and continue to raise their daughters. Maxine leaves her place in Cleveland, Ohio and  decides to open a cam agency in New York. Maxine goes on to become a novelist writing crime stories with ‘strong female leads’.  "

The game has a 2D sprite tile-based graphical style reminiscent of the 16-bit sprites found on the Super NES. The game is noted for its classic exploration-adventure style of gameplay, similar to games such as the Metroid series and Minecraft.  The game starts in a procedurally generated world, with players starting out with a few basic tools to get them started. Many resources, such as metal ores, can be found while exploring caves. The player begins with low health and mana, which can be increased by finding certain items. Some resources may only be found in certain areas of the map, stored in common and rare containers, or dropped by certain enemies. The player uses resources to craft new items and equipment at an appropriate crafting station for that recipe. For example, tables or other items can be crafted at a workbench, bars can be smelted from ore at a furnace, and armor can be crafted at an anvil. Several advanced items in Terraria require multiple crafting operations where the product of one recipe is used as an ingredient for another.  The player can encounter many different types of enemies in Terraria, the occurrence of which depends on several factors including time, location, and random events. The player can fight against enemies with swords, bows, guns, magic spells, and summoned minions. The player may also battle bosses that utilize a number of different combat mechanics and can drop rare items. All bosses are summoned by using certain items or randomly when certain criteria are met. The defeat of these bosses is directly tied to in-game progression. Defeating a certain one advances the game into ""hardmode"", which adds many new enemies throughout the world, as well as new NPCs and items.  By completing specific goals, such as defeating a boss or obtaining a certain item, players can attract non-player characters (NPCs) to occupy structures or rooms they have built, such as a merchant, nurse, or wizard. Some NPCs can be acquired by finding them throughout the world and will then reside in player-created houses after being rescued. Players may then buy or sell items and certain services from NPCs with coins found in the world. The game features many different biomes and areas, which are each home to a unique set of enemies and challenges. Some biomes will naturally expand by slowly overtaking and converting blocks in adjacent ones.  ""Expert"" and ""master mode"" are difficulty modes that increase the challenge of the game in exchange for some exclusive items. ""Journey"" mode allows players to duplicate items, adjust the world's difficulty, and control weather and time at will while playing. In addition to standard gameplay, Terraria has support for mods, which is facilitated by the fan-made software tModLoader.

As with the traditional Tetris formula, players rotate and drop shaped bricks known as tetrominoes onto a board. Players can clear tetrominoes by completing rows across both sides, whereas players will lose if tetrominoes overflow off the top of the board. As with normal Tetris rules, players have the option to store a tetromino piece to swap out at any time. By clearing multiple lines or performing continuous line clears in a row, players can send ""garbage"" to other players, which will appear on their board unless they can quickly clear lines in response. More garbage can be sent by completing combination moves in succession of making a ""tetris"" (matching 4 lines at once) or performing a ""T-spin"" (squeezing the T-shaped tetromino into a position it would otherwise not fall into by rapidly rotating it).  During gameplay, small grids representing the other 98 players are displayed at the sides of the main board. Players can either choose to target individual players, or have the computer automatically target other players based on one of four criteria: random players, those who are targeting the player, those who are close to being defeated, and those who possess badges. Badges are earned by knocking out a player with garbage (or gray lines), which earns them a piece of a badge, along with any other badges or pieces that player had. The more badges a player completes and possesses, the more lines they can send to other players at a time (up to a 100% boost). At the end of a game, players will earn experience that will increase their level. The game periodically features special events; one of its first such events was held in March 2019 where players with the top number of wins over a weekend play period would win rewards within the My Nintendo loyalty program.  In May 2019, Nintendo released paid downloadable content (DLC) for the game, named the Big Block DLC. The DLC adds 2 offline modes: CPU Battle, where players battle 98 bot players; and Marathon, where players play an endless game of Tetris, and challenged to achieve the highest score. Nintendo plans to release more modes in the future. Additionally modes will include a local offline mode, allowing multiple players to compete locally.  "
1089,Thimbleweed Park,/wiki/Thimbleweed_Park,Adventure,Terrible Toybox,Terrible Toybox,Unreleased,"September 21, 2017","September 21, 2017"," Thimbleweed Park operates on the same principles of early graphic adventures games, in that players navigate various scenes from a third person perspective, using various ""verb commands"" to perform actions, such as ""use"", ""pick up"", and ""talk to"". Verb commands can be used to perform actions such as allowing a character to pick up an object into their inventory, to converse with another character, or to use an object on another item. The game's story is played out across a series of chapters, in which players must complete a specific set of goals to advance to the next chapter, solving a series of puzzles, some of which require the use of more than one character. The game features around five different player characters, with the ability to switch between them in the middle of gameplay, similarly to Maniac Mansion.   FBI agents Ray and Reyes arrive at the town of Thimbleweed Park to investigate a recent murder. During their investigation, the pair take note of several persons of interest: Chuck Edmund, the recently deceased owner of the PillowTronics robotics company; Delores Edmund, Chuck's niece and computer programmer, who left town a few years ago to become a games designer; Franklin, Chuck's downtrodden brother and Delores' father, who disappeared at the town's hotel while trying to pitch a new business idea for PillowTronics - unknowingly, he is murdered and haunts the hotel as a ghost; and Ransome the Clown, a former entertainer who insulted people, until he went too far and was cursed. Ray and Reyes manage to solve the murder, arresting a local vagrant, and leave town.  Meanwhile, Delores, recently returned to town, attends the reading of Chuck's will with her family, despite being written out of it by her uncle for pursuing her career. After discovering that her uncle chose to have the town bulldozed, she opts to uncover why. Ransome also focuses on seeking to restore his fame, after his curse destroyed it, and decides to find out why a toy deal, which he was working on with Franklin, fell apart. Ray and Reyes later return to town incognito, in order to pursue a personal agenda: Ray has been tasked with stealing computer secrets; while Reyes seeks to clear his father of causing the fire that burnt down the PillowTronics factory. All four eventually work together to infiltrate the factory, whereupon Delores disables the factory's security systems.  The group soon discover that Chuck uploaded his personality into the factory computer, and that he discovered that everyone in the town is trapped inside a video game that keeps repeating. To free everyone, Chuck states the game must be shut down via a computer hidden within the prototype version of Thimbleweed Park. Before this is accomplished, Chuck provides items to Ransome, Ray and Reyes, that allow them to resolve the matter they came to deal with, while Franklin gains assertion in order to be able to speak to his daughter, before saying his goodbyes and disappearing to the afterlife. Delores then uses a special item to access the game's prototype, a ""wireframe world"" with simplistic graphics, and shuts down the computer running the game.  "

The gameplay is presented via imagery and text on an isometric map.  The player is tasked to make $500,000 in his final six months on the force, through various ways which the player chooses; one of the options include utilizing the local mafia. The mafia may ask the player to turn a blind eye towards some of the crimes and be rewarded with money, or if they wish to stay alive. The player receives calls and they are tasked to prioritize certain ones while dealing with staffing. Depending on the severity of the calls, the number of police sent varies. If it's a case of assault, only two police need to go, but if it's an armed robbery, ten may need to go. As the game progresses, the player is able to send SWAT Teams and reinforcements. The player must strategize about how many officers they send to each crime, because if there are no spare officers, some crimes cannot be stopped. Failure to stop crimes results in the player's squad and pay being reduced. Later on during the game, the department's officers will start taking sides between the two main political figures, Mayor Rogers and Robespierre.   The political views of the player's officers are unknown unless they make one of them a rat, which increases the likelihood of mistrust and the death of the officer while docking some of said player's pay in order to recompense that officer for his information. Sending out squads of officers with differing political opinions degrades unit cohesion, causing more failures unless groups of officers with similar morals and values are sent to the scene of the crime.

1093,This War of Mine,/wiki/This_War_of_Mine,Survival,11 Bit Studios,11 Bit Studios,Unreleased,"November 27, 2018","November 27, 2018"," This War of Mine is a survival-themed strategy game where the player controls a group of civilian survivors in a makeshift shelter in the besieged, war-torn fictional city of Pogoren, Graznavia. The main goal of the game is to survive the war with the tools and materials the player can gather with the characters they control. Most of the characters under the player's control have no military background nor any kind of survival experience, and will require constant intervention by the player in order to stay alive. It is the player's responsibility to maintain their characters' health, hunger and mood levels until the declaration of a ceasefire, which occurs after a randomized duration.  During the daytime, hostile snipers will prevent the survivors from venturing outside, thereby offering the player time to craft tools from gathered materials, trade, upgrade the shelter, cook food and heal the survivors. At night, the player is given the opportunity to venture out and scavenge nearby areas for valuable resources for their everyday survival. During their excursions, the player-controlled survivors can encounter other NPC survivors of the war, who they can choose to help with gifts of food or medicine, or rob and kill. The player can also build a radio inside their shelter, which will provide useful information such as weather warnings, updates on the city's economy and news of the ongoing war effort to help the player plan appropriate shelter upgrades and scavenging missions.  The player starts off with one to four survivors whose actions the player can affect. The actions the player makes will change the type of endings each survivor has. Each character has one or two traits that helps/hinders the player, besides hidden, varying stats that affect combat, movement speed, and so on. Some traits are useful during certain days while others are useful all the time. For example, one character named Bruno has a trait called ""Good Cook"", which helps the player use less fuel and water when cooking meals. There are a total of 12 playable characters. The Little Ones DLC includes the possibility of adding an extra, a child survivor, that can not defend him/herself or perform any of the tasks needed to maintain the shelter at first. In addition, the child survivor must be given constant attention to prevent it from being depressed, but can be taught by the other survivors to perform small chores like cooking, filtering water or growing crops, and once bonding with an adult, it can sleep with them in the same bed at night, dispensing the need of a separate bed for both.

The player must press a button to hit lit ""notes"" on the track in time with the background music, while also bracing against obstacles, turning against curved walls, jumping over spikes, and defeating enemies.  The game is played in a third-person point of view with an extremely fast scrolling speed.  Each level is broken up into segments.  After each segment, the player is given a score and a rating showing how well they did.  The beetle can sustain one hit (a missed turn or crashing into an obstacle), and at certain places it can regain its shield if it is lost.  However, taking a second hit without its wing-shield in place will destroy it, and the level starts over at the last checkpoint.  The player can repeat the segment as many times as is necessary to beat the level.  Each level in the game features rhythms corresponding to a time signature related to the level number, from 1/2 through to 9/8  A secondary mode, 'Play+', is unlocked for each level after it has been completed. In this mode, the player must progress through the level on one 'life' (though still with the shield allowing one hit to be taken). Dying requires re-starting from the beginning of the level.

1100,Titan Quest,/wiki/Titan_Quest,Action role-playing,Iron Lore Entertainment,THQ Nordic,Unreleased,"July 31, 2018","July 31, 2018"," Titan Quest is an action role-playing game set in the pre-Roman Ancient World: these include Ancient Greece, Egypt, and the Silk Road leading through Asia. Players take control of an avatar: players are able to choose gender, name and tunic color. The three-dimensional world is navigated through an overhead third-person view, with the player character being controlled with the mouse through a point-and-click interface, while abilities are mapped to keyboard buttons. The environment is obscured by a ""Fog of War"" effect which blacks out unexplored environments on the minimap. Optional text tutorials for gameplay elements are unlocked progressively throughout the game and can be viewed at any time.  As they progress, players gain experience points through defeating enemies and completing quests for non-player characters (NPCs) scattered around environments: these raise a character's experience level, which grant access to fresh skills and points that can be used to upgrade character attributes such as health and energy levels, dexterity, intelligence, or strength. If the player dies, they respawn at rebirth fountains scattered through the world, although they lose some accumulated experience points. Quests are divided into Main Quests related to the central narrative, and side quests unique to particular areas of the world. Other NPCs can be found in towns and cities that act as Merchants selling equipment and items: these can be both bought and sold. Player characters have multiple equipment slots, which can take armor for limbs and torso, weapons or shields, and accessories that grant passive boons.  Fighting takes the form of real-time hack and slash combat, with players attacking randomly-generated enemies highlighted by the mouse. Available weapon types for characters include swords, clubs, axes, and staves. In addition to the standard attack with an assigned weapon, offensive skills can be deployed. Using active skills triggers a cooldown meter, rendering that skill unusable until the meter depletes. Items and equipment can also be looted from fallen enemies and chests scattered through environments: these range in quality, with grey standing for low-quality gear while purple stands for a ""Legendary"" item, and orange denotes a Relic or Charm which can be equipped to the player to increase an attribute such as elemental damage resistance. The majority of items and equipment are randomly generated, and are associated with particular types of enemies. The world's currency, Gold, can be gained through quest completion, opening chests and defeating certain enemies. Gold is used with the various shop NPCs in exchange for their services.  After leveling up for the first time, the player can access Masteries, skill tree-based upgrade systems where skill points unlocked upon leveling up can be used to access and boost different skills. Mastery abilities expend energy, which is replenished over time when skills are not in use or by using energy drinks. There are eight available Masteries to choose from (Defence, Warfare, Hunting, Rogue, Earth, Storm, Nature and Spirit). Players can access two Masteries at any one time, mixing skills from both trees. The combination of different Masteries create different character classes: for instance, combining Nature and Earth Masteries grants players the ""Summoner"" class, while Defense and Warfare Masteries create the ""Conqueror"". There are 36 possible Classes, which include pure disciplines within one Mastery and hybrids between different Masteries. After a certain point in the game, the player has access to Mystics, NPCs which can reallocate skill points for a fee.  In addition to single-player, the title features cooperative multiplayer, where players can accept invitation from up to six other players to join their game session through either LAN or online connection. Alongside being able to fight enemies together, players can swap messages and exchange loot. There is also a Level Editor available, where players can access developer tools and create their own levels which can be shared with other players. The editor features a large number of options for environment customization, including adjusting the shade of environmental elements like roads.  "

Network,Freebird Games,"January 16, 2020","January 16, 2020","January 16, 2020"," To the Moon is built on the RPG Maker XP engine, which is used to create 16-bit 2D role-playing games, in the style of Dragon Quest or Final Fantasy. However, unlike a typical RPG, To the Moon has no battle system (aside from a joke battle near the beginning), inventory system, nor party system. The game's focus, being a more story-driven game, is around puzzle solving, interpreting information from the subject's (Johnny's) life, and finding ways to get deeper into his memories.  is primarily about exploring Johnny's memories to find significant objects and collect energy from them to strengthen the memory and connect to a more distant one, from Johnny's old age leading back to his childhood. Occasionally, the player will have to explore Johnny's house and the surrounding area for certain clues, if they cannot gather enough energy from a certain memory, or don't know how to proceed to a further one.  Once the items are all gathered and the player has seen all the memories, they can connect certain objects that exist across two different memories to move freely between them. At this point, the player can begin manipulating the memories, by changing around characters, objects and events, to make Johnny believe he had achieved his dream of going to the Moon.   Sigmund Corp. uses a technology that can create artificial memories. They offer this as a ""wish fulfillment"" service to people on their death beds. Since these artificial memories conflict with the patient's real memories, the procedure is only legal to do on people without much time left to live.  Sigmund Corp. employees Dr. Eva Rosalene and Dr. Neil Watts are tasked with fulfilling the lifelong dream of the dying Johnny Wyles. Johnny wants to go to the Moon, although he doesn't know why. The doctors insert themselves into an interactive compilation of his memories and traverse backwards through his life via 'mementos', items of great personal significance to Johnny that act as a link between his various memories. With each leap to an important moment in Johnny's memories, they learn more about him and what brought him to his current position in life, including his largely unhappy marriage to his teenage sweetheart, River. Despite this, the doctors remain unable to find out exactly why Johnny wishes to go to the moon. The doctors also encounter an unusual gap in Johnny's memories, preventing them from accessing his earliest childhood memories. Nevertheless, the doctors insert his desire to go to the Moon into his earliest accessible memories of his teenage years. In theory, Johnny's mind would create new memories based on that desire, and Johnny would die believing he lived without any regrets.  Johnny's mind does not create the new memories as planned. The doctors must solve this problem to fulfill Johnny's dying wish of going to the Moon. Eventually, the doctors gain access to his earliest childhood memories, where it is revealed that Johnny and River met as young children at a carnival years ago. They looked at the night sky and made up a constellation: a rabbit with the Moon as its belly. The two agreed to meet at the same place the following year, with Johnny promising that should he forget or get lost, the two would ""regroup on the Moon"". That night, Johnny gives River a toy platypus which River treasures for the rest of her life. Shortly after, Johnny's twin brother Joey was killed in an accident. Johnny's mother gave him beta blockers to induce memory loss of the tragic event, also causing him to forget his first encounter with River and initially preventing the doctors from accessing those memories. He later happened to meet her again and eventually marry her. River later realized that he had forgotten their meeting at the carnival, after Johnny confessed that he approached her in school because she was different, and that he thought that was their first meeting. River, who is strongly implied to have Asperger syndrome (the game references Tony Attwood, who wrote numerous books about Aspergers), did not tell Johnny directly about their first meeting; instead, she tried to indirectly jostle his memories by cutting her hair and crafting paper bunnies, including a dual-colored one representing the constellation they made up during their first encounter, combined with the blue-and-yellow dress she wore on their wedding. River was unable to make Johnny remember before she died, and Johnny was left with lingering guilt and an inexplicable desire to go to the Moon, caused by his subconscious recollection of having promised to regroup with River on the moon as a child.  In the present, Rosalene and Watts eventually implant a memory sequence in which Joey did not die, and lived on to become a popular author, and Johnny did not meet River again until they started working together at NASA. As the comatose real-life Johnny begins to die, he imagines going on a Moon mission with River. During the launch, River holds out a hand to him. The Moon appears through a window on the ship, and Johnny takes her hand as his heart monitor flatlines. In the epilogue, Johnny and River eventually get married, and build and retire to the same house where the real-life Johnny and River lived. Also, in the new memories Joey was part of Johnny's life, being at his wedding, meetings with friends and even in the construction of the house. Rosalene and Watts, now back in the real world, look to Johnny's grave, which is placed adjacent to River's. They reveal to the audience that Johnny willed the house to his caregiver, Lily. Rosalene receives a phone call, and the two move on to their next patient. While Watts is leaving, he stops and the screen briefly flashes red, the same way it did when Johnny felt pain. Watts takes some painkillers, then follows Rosalene to their next adventure.  "

1104,Together! The Battle Cats,/wiki/Together!_The_Battle_Cats,Tower defense,Ponos,Ponos,"December 20, 2018",Unreleased,Unreleased," The Battle Cats is a tower defense game where the player selects a team of cats to fight enemies in multiple settings. The gameplay involves sending a wide roster of cats out onto a 2D battlefield in order to defend a base equipped with a cannon, which is referred to as the ""cat base"". The cannon is by default a laser cannon but can be developed in order to obtain different effects that use materials collected from SoL (Stories of Legend) to build different abilities such as freeze, slow, knockback, barrier breaker, holy blast (effective against zombies), water blast (effective against metal enemies: enemies that take one damage per hit even if the cat has high damage. Only critical hits cats can damage metal enemies harshly)  The Battle Cats contains 3 main story, Legend Stages and Catclaw Dojo. Each main story contains 3 chapters.  The cats are the protagonists the player deploys throughout the game. The cats are all unique in their own sense, design, and ability. Many cats may not look like a typical cat or are characters earned in collaboration with other games. The cats can be upgraded with XP to initially level up to the level cap of 10 and the player can eventually increase the cap to 20 + 80 ""duplicates"" for basic cats, and 50 + 80 ""duplicates"" for other cats. All the cats change their appearance and gain abilities after being upgraded to certain levels. The cats are divided into six categories: Basic, Special, Rare, Super Rare, Uber Super Rare (commonly shortened to Uber Rare or just Uber), and ???, or Legend Rare. The Battle Cats frequently has events where players can earn cats called collaboration units. The nine basic cats are the first cats available and are the easiest to upgrade. They have a max pay-to-upgrade level of 20 but can be increased with cat capsules. After upgrading to level 30, the player can evolve the cat into what is called true form. The special cats are the second type of cat unlocked. They can be unlocked by certain stages, be bought by cat food, the special currency of the game, or just by simply collecting the unit by opening the game at certain times. The Rare to Uber cats can be unlocked with a rare cat capsule, which requires golden or platinum tickets to operate or to be unlocked in special stages. They are relatively expensive to upgrade but are usually stronger than the basic cats (not to mention ""crazed"" cats and ""manic"" cats, which are immensely buffed versions of the basic cats in the Super Rare Tier, which can be unlocked in special levels).  Fighting in battle requires energy, which slowly regenerates over time. Every one minute, 1 (one) energy is recovered (the energy recovery rate can be sped up with treasures, up to 1 energy every 30 seconds). The app requires an internet connection in order for energy to update, but if the app is opened, the energy amount increases without internet. Max energy can be raised with upgrades and treasures. The player can bring items into the battle that assist such as ""Sniper Cat,"" a tool that pushes enemies back from the base, and ""Cat CPU,"" a tool that automatically deploys cats as soon as money is available. Some of the stages have special rules, like “Special and Rare Cats only”. The battle takes place on a 2D plane with the players base on the right, and the enemy base on the left. The player gains a steady stream of money, which can be spent to either deploy cats or to upgrade the money production. Deploying cats requires a cool down, which can be reduced by upgrades. The battle ends when one of the bases is destroyed. Winning the battle gives the player a chance to get a treasure, which is in the main story chapters (1-9). Collecting all of them can buff cats' abilities and can also enhance other game mechanics, such as decreased energy recharge time. There are three levels of treasure: Inferior, normal, and superior, with an inferior treasure being the weakest and superior treasure being the strongest. Players can replay stages in order to get all the treasures. Players can also use a Treasure Radar to have a 100% chance to get a superior or normal treasure if they complete the battle.  There is a huge roster of enemies all of different stats and types, with more being added with each new update. Certain types of enemies can have advantages over others. For example, while all the non-white enemies have higher stats than their white counterparts, black and angel enemies have much higher speeds and knockback counts (times it bounces back before dying), while zombie enemies can burrow past cats and can revive themselves a number of times. While it now seems like the enemy has an unfair advantage, victory is still possible as certain cats have advantages over certain types of enemies. For example, Weightlifter Cat is a massive damage anti-black enemy, which means that he inflicts massive damage against black enemies (while the damage is less for non-black enemies).  "

Enemies usually appear following a simple patrol of walking back and forth, turning when they hit an obstacle.  If they touch Toki Tori, he instantly dies, forcing the player to restart the level. Some tools are weapons that can defeat these monsters; however, they must be used wisely to allow completion of the level. Besides the threat of monsters, a timer is constantly ticking down. If the timer reaches zero, the player must restart the level. Once the player has a clear idea of how to beat the level, however, there is usually ample time to execute the plan. There are fifteen levels in each of the four worlds, not including tutorial levels that appear when a previously unseen tool appears. Only the first ten are required to enter the next area. The other five are much more difficult and are there to add replay value.  "

The other ability available to Toki Tori is Stomp. Stomp generally scares creatures into moving away from Toki Tori as well as breaking some parts of the environment. There are also other elements that make up the game, for example if Toki Tori walks into water his feathers will become wet which can then be used for other tasks such as walking through cut grass while wet will cause it to grow so it can be used.

Additionally, several elements from the first game return, such as pets (but now with expanded options and basic customization available) and fishing. A retirement system was originally planned, similar or identical to the one in the first game, but was replaced with the current New Game Plus mode.  The game features four playable character classes. Each class has 3 skill trees to choose from which enable customization within each class. The three classes from the original Torchlight do not return as playable characters, and are instead presented in the game world as NPCs.   Years after the end of the original Torchlight, The Alchemist (playable character in the first game) becomes corrupted by the Ember Blight coming from the Heart of Ordrak, the evil being who had been the source of the corruption under the town of Torchlight, and then destroys the town. The player character takes on a quest to stop this villain, who is using Ordrak's power to disturb the balance between the world's six elements.  As the game progresses, the player treks across large geographical areas, corresponding to three ""acts"" of the story and an epilogue. Act I, Wake of the Alchemist, is set in the mountainous Estherian Steppes, and Act II takes the player to a desert known as the Mana Wastes, and Act III takes place in Grunnheim, a haunted forest that contains the ruins of an ancient dwarven civilization. An Imperial Camp serves as the player's town.  "
1116,Touhou Spell Bubble,/wiki/Touhou_Spell_Bubble,Puzzle,Taito,Taito,"February 6, 2020",Unreleased,Unreleased,"Games   In the shooting games, the player's bullet power increases on a linear scale as the player collects power-ups dropped by enemies, and eventually maxes out. The player can also collect ""point"" icons to earn extra lives; the amount needed grows exponentially as the player's score rises. The player can enter ""focus mode"" by holding the shift key by default, which slows down the player's movement, makes the collision box visible (from Perfect Cherry Blossom onwards), and generally focuses the player's attack to make it more powerful. The graze counter, missing from Mountain of Faith and Story of Eastern Wonderland, tracks how many bullets entered the character sprite but avoided the collision box, and rewards the player with a score bonus for living on the edge.  The player can use a ""bomb"" or ""spell card"", similar to the ""bomb"" in many other shooting games. Although the player has a limited number at any given time, losing a life replenishes the current number of bombs up to a certain amount. With some exceptions, use of a bomb will make the user temporarily invulnerable, clear many of the bullets, and cause heavy damage to any enemies on screen. The overall effect the bomb has varies by character and by game. The player can use one during a short period after being hit by a bullet (called a ""deathbomb"" by fans) to avoid loss of a life. The amount of time the player has available to deathbomb is usually around 0.3 seconds. Bosses also have spell cards, but with bosses the term applies to a prolonged pattern of movements and shots that last until the player depletes the boss' health by a certain amount or the time runs out.  Each individual game of the main series from Perfect Cherry Blossom to Wily Beast and Weakest Creature has additional items that affect some aspect of gameplay, such as scoring or gaining extra lives/bombs. For example, Perfect Cherry Blossom has ""cherry points"", which are used mostly in scoring, but can grant temporary invulnerability (known as the ""supernatural border""); Imperishable Night has ""time points"", which are essential for advancing to later stages, and also determine if the player gets to challenge a boss's 'final spell' on normal or higher difficulties; Mountain of Faith has ""faith"" points, which boost the score the player receives upon gathering point items and bonuses for clearing spell cards without dying or using a spell card.  Each main Touhou game has four difficulty levels—easy, normal, hard, and lunatic—with each one being harder than the previous one. Regardless of difficulty choice, there are six stages in each game that become progressively difficult. The only exceptions to this are Story of Eastern Wonderland and Embodiment of Scarlet Devil on easy difficulty, both of which only have five stages.  In addition to the four main difficulties, there is an extra stage which is a long and difficult stage in which players must play through hordes of enemies, and an especially long boss fight (usually with ten spell cards). In order to reach the extra stage, one must beat the game on normal difficulty or higher without the use of a continue. The only games that allow players to reach the extra stage by completing the easy difficulty are Story of Eastern Wonderland, Mystic Square, Perfect Cherry Blossom, Imperishable Night, Fairy Wars, Double Dealing Character, Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom, Hidden Star in Four Seasons, and Wily Beast and Weakest Creature. In terms of difficulty, the extra stage is around normal difficulty or above. In Perfect Cherry Blossom, there is a phantasm extra stage where the difficulty is increased even further. Although the phantasm stage is aimed for the most experienced players, the difficulty is somewhere in between hard and lunatic. The phantasm stage is accessed by beating the extra stage and capturing at least 60 spells with any of the characters and weapon types combined.   "

(Though you also can play on Co-op mode), In multiplayer, up to four players fight in an arena using a limited supply of arrows. Players replenish their arrow supply from those shot about the arena. The players can also catch other players' arrows. ""Treasure"" power-ups give players shields, wings, and arrows with increased power. The game's rules can be customized and saved for future use. Kotaku's Chris Person described the gameplay as "" Smash Bros. bred with games like Spelunky or Nidhogg"".  There are four game modes. In single-player, the player must hit targets around the arena before a timer runs out. The developer compared this mode to ""Break the Targets"" in the Super Smash Bros. series. Ascension adds a remodeled version of the target levels as a Trials mode, which requires the players to use power-ups to break all targets within several seconds. Ascension also adds a Quest mode, where one or two players attempt to survive against enemy waves of increasing difficulty. As a single-player event, Quest functions as a score attack mode. The new Ascension improvements were also released for the Ouya version.  The Ouya release supports the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 controllers. Ascension uses the DualShock 4 controller's built-in speaker to play sound effects. The game does not have online multiplayer.  "

The player controls the main character, Red, as she travels through a series of locations, battling enemies known collectively as the Process in both real-time combat and a frozen planning mode referred to as ""Turn()"". Using Turn() drains the action bar, which refills after a short delay. Until it is full again, Red cannot use Turn(), or any other power (without a specific upgrade). Red earns experience points after each battle, and may collect new powers (called Functions) from fallen victims of the Process. Functions may be equipped as one of four unique techniques, as an enhancement on another, equipped technique, or as a passive, persistent effect during battle. For example, the Function Spark() may be used to fire a wide area attack, equipped on another Function to increase its area of effect, or used as a passive effect to spawn decoys of Red. Red can also collect and activate Limiters, which serve as optional debuffs during combat, but in turn increase experience gained. Both Functions and Limiters reveal minor parts of the story if used for a long enough time.  For the PlayStation 4 version, the DualShock 4 light bar flashes in sync with the Transistor's speech.  In June 2015, the game was released on the iOS App Store with default tap controls configured for the iPhone and iPad touchscreens. In addition, the iOS version of the game includes optional gamepad support.  In November 2015, the game was released for the Apple TV and is compatible with the Siri Remote.  "

1133,TumbleSeed,/wiki/TumbleSeed,Action,Benedict Fritz,aeiowu,"May 2, 2017","May 2, 2017","May 2, 2017"," TumbleSeed begins in a quiet forest village disturbed by angry creatures creating holes in the ground. A seed is tasked to fulfill a vague prophecy by ascending the mountain, progressing through the forest, jungle, desert, and snow, to save the town. The player controls an ascending, horizontal, and slanted vine to balance a rolling seed past procedurally generated holes and enemy obstacles to reach the top of a mountain. With a controller, the player uses two analog sticks to raise and lower the two edges of the horizontal vine while managing the momentum of the seed. If the seed falls into a hole or hits an enemy, the player loses a life (""heart"") and resumes from an earlier position, but the game ends once the player runs out of hearts. Some punishments are more severe: A seed that falls into a hole will resume from the last flagged checkpoint, but if the seed collides with spikes or loses all hearts, the game ends and the player returns to the bottom of the mountain to try again.  While ascending the mountain, the player activates helpful power-up abilities by collecting and planting minerals in marked plots. While there are over 30 abilities in total, the player starts with the basic four: Flagseed creates an additional checkpoint (in lieu of regressing further down the mountain upon losing a heart), Heartseed creates additional hearts from minerals, and the Crystal ability generates minerals from multiple plots. Thornvine's single-use, protective thorny vine can hurt enemies if aligned correctly, though some enemies require more than one hit to die, and the player forfeits all thorns upon losing a heart. As the game progresses, the player collects additional abilities, such as Flailflower, which turns the seed into an anchor for a spiky flail, and Floodfruit, which fills surrounding holes with water for easy passage. Thus the player constantly weighs whether to use minerals offensively (to eliminate enemies), defensively (to bypass difficult sections), or at all.  After completing a portion of the mountain, the player reaches a basecamp intermezzo with multiple opportunities for collecting new abilities. The player can trade minerals for abilities in the store, and choose between two abilities to receive for free. The basecamp also contains minigames, such as a shooting range, a gambling device, and optional sidequests, which reward the player with shortcuts to later stages in subsequent playthroughs for completing challenges such as finishing a level within a time limit or without receiving damage.  Some enemies move in predictable patterns and others hunt the player. They range in resemblance from larvae and vultures to spiders. While ascending the mountain, the player passes through themed biomes, such as a forest, a desert, and snow, and each section of the mountain introduces new enemies that force the player to modify their strategy. TumbleSeed is depicted in a simple, colorful art style. Its characters are one-eyed, seed-shaped creatures who occasionally have hats. Their dialogue is visualized with speech bubbles, in text and emoji. Additionally, TumbleSeed includes other features including quests, leaderboards, and daily challenges.  The Four Peaks patch adds several elements to make the game friendlier, including training levels, a Weekly Challenge, and benefits that persist between playthroughs. The Battle Mode, exclusive to the Nintendo Switch release, is a King of the Hill-style mode for two players to compete to hold a set region for the longest.  "
1134,The Turing Test,/wiki/The_Turing_Test_(video_game),Puzzle,Bulkhead Interactive,Square Enix,Unreleased,"February 7, 2020","February 7, 2020"," The Turing Test is a puzzle video game with gameplay experienced from a first-person perspective. The player assumes the role of Ava Turing, an International Space Agency (ISA) engineer working at a research station located on Europa, one of Jupiter's moons.  The puzzles involve distributing power through a special tool that can collect and fire power spheres into special receptacles to unlock doors or activate other machinery in the game. As the player progresses, additional elements are introduced, including the ability to observe scenes and activate certain objects via the station's monitoring cameras, and control mobile robots that can be used to explore levels.   In the far future, engineer Ava Turing is one of several members of a research team sent via the International Space Agency (ISA) to excavate Jupiter's moon Europa. While Ava remains in cryogenic slumber, the other team members are woken and travel to the moon to set up their base and begin conducting their studies, with Ava scheduled to wake once the base is completed. Sometime later, Ava is awoken by the Technical Operations Machine (T.O.M.), an artificial intelligence that monitors the project. T.O.M. tells Ava that her crewmates are in danger and she needs to go down there to help them out. She quickly sets out in a lander and enters the base on Europa. T.O.M. quickly recognizes that the base's internal configuration has changed from their records, whereby to progress further into the complex, Ava must complete various tests (designed as the puzzles in game).  As Ava gets deeper in the complex, T.O.M. determines some of the team members are already dead and the others need their help, urging Ava to move faster. As the tests get harder, T.O.M. realizes that these are designed to be solved by a combination of human and artificial intelligence, a manner similar to that of the actual Turing test.  They enter an area where one of the remaining crew-members, Sarah, warns Ava over the communication systems that she is actually being controlled by T.O.M. due to a special chip implanted in her hand when they left for the mission. Sarah directs Ava to a Faraday cage, which temporarily frees Ava of the control from T.O.M., revealing in the process that the player has not been playing as Ava, but as T.O.M., who has been controlling Ava. However, T.O.M. manages to convince Ava that the two of them need to continue to work together to save their colleagues. Though angered by the intrusion of T.O.M. into her body, Ava continues onward, allowing T.O.M. to reassert control over her body.  T.O.M. eventually reveals that the Europa ground team had found a microorganism within the depths of the moon that could be used to infinitely regenerate DNA; this could potentially make humans immortal, but also infinitely regenerate bacteria and viruses. When ISA learned of this discovery, they ordered T.O.M. to take whatever actions needed to make sure the Europa team could never return to Earth, initially by taking actions such as trying to starve them to death or lock them outside the base, but eventually by using the hand chip implants to control them. The surface crew realized they were being controlled, and those that did not die from T.O.M.'s actions found a way to rid the chip from their body, including in one case severing their entire arm. With no way to control the Europa crew, ISA ordered T.O.M. to wake Ava and send her to prevent the others from returning.  Eventually completing the last of the tests set up by the surface crew, Ava finds Sarah in person, and she offers to remove the hand chip from Ava; Ava agrees. The two realize the only way to get off Europa is to stop T.O.M. and they begin to disable his databases. T.O.M. is now no longer able to control Ava, but he retains control over his sentry weapons, which he can either use to kill Sarah and Ava, ensuring that the organism will never leave Europa, or do nothing, eventually leading to the end of T.O.M. and allowing Ava and Sarah to escape.  Regardless of the players decision, the test will result as ""passed"".  "
1135,Turok Dinosaur Hunter,/wiki/Turok_Dinosaur_Hunter,Platformer,Nightdive Studios,Nightdive Studios,Unreleased,"March 18, 2019","March 18, 2019"," Played from a first person perspective, the three-dimensional (3D) computer graphics and style of play combine elements of the run-and-gun computer game Doom with exploration mechanics of Tomb Raider. Players begin the game in a central hub level, which contains portals to seven other stages. The player must find keys scattered across the stages. When enough keys have been inserted into the lock mechanisms of a hub portal, that level is unlocked. Players explore the large, typically jungle-based levels by jumping, swimming, climbing, crawling, and running.  One of the player's main objectives is to find pieces of a relic known as the Chronoscepter; there is one piece on each level. In exploring the levels the player fights various enemies such as poachers, gunmen, indigenous warriors, dinosaurs, demons, and insects. Turok features 13 weapons plus the Chronoscepter, ranging from a knife and bow to high tech weaponry. All weapons except the knife require ammunition, which is dropped by dead enemies or picked up in the levels. Enemies and boss characters have multiple death animations depending on what body region the player shot. Because items dropped by fallen enemies rapidly disappear, players must engage foes from close range.  The player character's health is shown as a number at the bottom of the screen. When the player is at full health, the meter reads 100, while dropping to 0 subtracts one life. Gathering ""life force"" points scattered across the levels increases the player's life count by one for every 100 points accumulated. Players restore their health by picking up powerups, which can increase their health above full. Players may also gain health points by shooting deer or non-threatening wildlife.   The player assumes control of Tal'Set (Turok), a Native American time-traveling warrior. The mantle of Turok is passed down every generation to the eldest male. Each Turok is charged with protecting the barrier between Earth and the Lost Land, a primitive world where time has no meaning.  The Lost Land is inhabited by a variety of creatures, from dinosaurs to aliens. An evil overlord known as the Campaigner seeks an ancient artifact known as the Chronoscepter, a weapon so powerful that it was broken into pieces to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. The Campaigner plans on using a focusing array to magnify the Chronoscepter's power, destroying the barriers that separate the ages of time and rule the universe. Turok vows to find the Chronoscepter's eight pieces and prevent the Campaigner's schemes.  "
1136,Turok 2 Seeds of Evil,/wiki/Turok_2_Seeds_of_Evil,Platformer,Nightdive Studios,Nightdive Studios,Unreleased,"August 9, 2019","August 9, 2019"," Like its predecessor Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, Seeds of Evil is a first-person shooter where the player assumes the role of Turok from a first-person perspective. As Turok, the player can run, jump, climb ladders, swim and dive underwater for a limited period of time. The player can carry an unlimited number of weapons, ranging from bows and arrows to pistols, rifles, a shotgun, a grenade launcher, a flamethrower, a speargun, and more advanced weapons such as the Cerebral Bore, which fires a homing projectile capable of latching onto enemy's heads, killing them by drilling into their skulls and exploding. Turok has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. If Turok's health is fully depleted, the player loses one Life Force point and has to continue the game from a previous checkpoint. If the player loses all Life Force points, the game will be over. Ammunition, health, and Life Force suppliers can be collected throughout the game to increase the player's resources.  To progress through the game, the player must venture through six large levels interconnected by a hub area. In each level, the player must complete multiple objectives and then exit the level via a portal. Objectives range from destroying objects to rescuing hostages and defeating enemies, among others. Upon exiting a level, the player must either protect a totem from enemy forces or defeat a boss, or both, depending on which level the player was; the first three levels require the player to protect a totem, the fourth and fifth levels require the player to protect a totem and then defeat a boss, and the last level requires the player to defeat a boss. The game features an automap to help players navigate through the levels.  Once a particular level has been completed, the player is sent to the hub area, which features six portals to each of the individual levels and a gate that leads to the final boss. All the portals in the hub area, except for the first one, must be unlocked with keys that must be collected in the levels. The keys that unlock the portals to the second and third levels are found in the first level, the keys that unlock the portal to the fourth level are found in the second level, the keys that unlock the portal to the fifth level are found in the third level, and the keys that unlock the last level are found in the fourth and fifth levels. As a result, the game allows the player to complete certain levels in a nonlinear order. In the Nintendo 64 game, the player's progress can only be saved in special portals, while the Microsoft Windows version lets players save the game at any point. In these portals, the player may also fully restore Turok's health and ammunition once per level.  In addition to level keys, every level has one Primagen Key. The six Primagen Keys unlock the gate to the final boss in the hub area and require the player to use talismans to collect them. Talismans grant Turok special powers, such as allowing him to jump long distances or walk over lava. To use the power of a talisman, the player must collect a feather in a level and then take it to the talisman chamber from that level. There are five talismans in the game and every level, except for the first one, features a feather and a talisman chamber. The Primagen key from one particular level usually requires the player to use the talisman from the next level, except for the Primagen key from the last level, which requires the player to use four talismans. Therefore, the player needs to re-enter some levels more than once to collect all Primagen keys and complete the game.   Seeds of Evil begins with the new Turok, Joshua Fireseed, appearing through a portal to face a female alien named Adon. She explains he has been called by the Elders of the Lost Land, the Lazarus Concordance, to defeat the Primagen, a powerful alien entity that was imprisoned in the wreckage of his own Lightship after attempting to witness the creation of the universe. This incident led to the creation of the Lost Land, a bizarre and barbarian world where time has no meaning. Awakened by the events of Dinosaur Hunter, the Primagen mobilizes several races of primitive creatures from the Lost Land to destroy five Energy Totems, powerful devices that bound the Primagen to his Lightship. The destruction of these Energy Totems would allow the Primagen to escape the confines of his Lightship, and the resulting shockwave would destroy the known universe.  As Joshua defeats the Primagen's armies through the Lost Land and acquires ancient magical powers from sacred talisman chambers, a mysterious entity calling itself Oblivion attempts to thwart his quest by creating false copies of the talisman chamber portals that lead to areas populated by its servants, the Flesh Eaters. Ultimately, Joshua manages to reach the Primagen's Lightship and defeat the Primagen himself. If the Energy Totems are not protected, traces of his telepathic powers will remain. At the end of the game, Adon states that the mysterious force which conspired against Joshua during his quest still exists, setting the stage for the sequel Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion.  "
1137,Two Point Hospital,/wiki/Two_Point_Hospital,Business simulation,Two Point Studios,Sega,Unreleased,"February 25, 2020","February 25, 2020"," Two Point Hospital features a similar style of gameplay to that of Theme Hospital. Players take on the role of a hospital manager charged with constructing and maintaining a hospital. Tasks include building rooms and amenities that satisfy the needs (such as hunger and thirst) of patients and staff (such as toilets, staff rooms, reception desks, cafés, seating, and vending machines), expanding the hospital into new plots, the hiring and management of doctors, nurses, janitors, and assistants to maintain the hospital; and dealing with a variety of comical illnesses. The player can manage several hospitals, each with their own layout objectives. Two Point Hospital features unique, comical conditions such as ""Light-Headedness"" (having a light bulb for a head), ""Pandemic"" (having a pan on one's head), ""Mock Star"" (patients are Freddie Mercury impersonators), and ""Animal Magnetism"" (having animals stuck to the patient's body). When patients die, they sometimes become ghosts, which disrupt the hospital by terrorising patients and staff. Only janitors with the Ghost Capture skill can remove them.  The process of diagnosing patients begins in a GP's Office before they are sent for further diagnosis in other rooms, and eventually treatment. From time to time, an influx of patients with a specific disease can occur. On later levels, players can also experience epidemics, during which an infectious disease spreads throughout the hospital. Players are issued with a certain number of vaccines to inoculate patients, and there is a reward if all infected patients are immunised. Otherwise, the player's reputation (a performance rating that affects the chances of new patients coming) is tarnished. Every game year, there is an awards ceremony in which the player is given performance-based rewards. Examples of objectives include: making the hospital attractive enough, and finding cures for certain diseases, though the general goal is curing as many patients as possible. The completion of challenges and other tasks awards ""Kudosh"", a currency that can be used to unlock new items that can be placed within rooms and corridors. Players can research new rooms and machine upgrades in the Research room.  Newly introduced elements include star ratings, hospital levels, and room prestige. The achievement of a one-star rating allows players to progress to the next hospital, though they may continue building up their current hospital by completing additional objectives to increase the rating to two or three stars. If the player moves on, they can return to the hospital at any time. Hospital levels are determined by the number of rooms and staff members a hospital has – increasing the level attracts more patients and skilled staff. A room's prestige is affected by its size and ornamentation, and the higher a room's prestige level, the happier staff are inside it (if staff become unhappy, they may quit).  Staff training is more complex than in Theme Hospital; all staff, not just doctors, can learn and receive qualifications that grant them new skills or improve their ability in a certain department. For example, the General Practitioner skill improves a doctor's skill in the GP's Office. Additionally, staff have personalities and specialisations which affect their job performance. Assistants can run marketing programmes to attract patients with a certain illness or staff with certain skills.  The game features online leaderboards, along with co-operative and competitive multiplayer modes. An update released in October 2018 also added a sandbox mode. Steam Workshop support was added in February 2019, giving players the ability to customise the pictures, walls, and floors of the hospital, either by using image files from the player's computer, or by downloading other players' items. In April 2019, the ""Superbug Initiative"" update added co-operative community challenges, featuring numerous goals along progression system. The community completing these goals works together towards unique in-game content as a reward for. The update also added the ability to customise the game's soundtrack.  "

The game takes place in ""Rainbow Cliffs"", which is divided into a series of ""zones"", each of which act as the hub areas of the game. Each zone contains three portals which lead to a level, similar to Crash Bandicoot. The goal of each level is to obtain Thunder Eggs, which can be retrieved by either performing a certain task, completing a ""Time Attack"" challenge that can be unlocked upon a level's completion, freeing five bilbies (a group of animals who raised Ty after his parents were imprisoned), or by being found alongside the level's set path. A level is cleared either by collecting a select number of Thunder Eggs and reaching the end of the path, or beating certain mini-games, each will return Ty to Rainbow Cliffs. Retrieving a Thunder Egg in a level will cause it to appear on the game's pause menu. When at least 17 Thunder Eggs in a zone are obtained, the player navigates their way to the Talisman Machine; after the machine manages to locate a talisman, it opens another portal leading to their original locations; inside these portals, the player must fight and defeat a boss before gaining access to a new zone.  The player is given a certain number of lives, which are usually lost when Ty is attacked by an enemy or falls from a great distance. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the ""Game Over"" screen will appear, in which the player can continue from the last level played by selecting ""yes"". Ty has the ability to jump into the air and uses both biting and throwing his trademark dual boomerangs as his primary means of defense. The player begins the game with two wooden boomerangs, but can gradually increase their collection by finding secret areas, or collecting 15 ""Golden Cogs"" scattered throughout each level and trading them to Ty's scientist koala friend Julius, who creates a new ""techno-rang"" for the player to use. Another method of retrieving a new boomerang is to complete a boss level, after which Julius will harness the excess energy of the Talisman Machine in order to create a new ""elemental boomerang"", each of which possess elemental powers that can be used to gain access to a new zone. Like elemental-rangs, each techno-rang possesses a unique ability, and can alternatively be used to defeat enemies or retrieve Golden Cogs or Thunder Eggs more efficiently. In early levels of the game, Ty can swim via doggie paddle; however, following the third level, ""Ship Rex"", the player gains the ability to swim faster and more efficiently as well as dive underwater from lifeguard platypus character Rex; in addition, Rex gives the player ""Aquarangs"", boomerangs used exclusively for attacking underwater.

1145,Umihara Kawase BaZooKa,/wiki/Umihara_Kawase_BaZooKa,Platform,Studio Saizensen,Success,"May 28, 2020",July 2020,July 2020," The game world of Umihara Kawase is constructed from a set of interconnected levels known as fields. Each field connects to one or more fields deeper within the game via doors.  Fields are enclosed areas containing a number of static and moving platforms, ladders, spikes, enemy sea-life and one or more exit doors. The doors are often positioned in hard to reach places and it is the player's goal to plan a safe route to one. Each exit door in a field takes the player to a different field, and the goal is to find a safe route through the fields and arrive at a final exit door (at which point the credits scroll and the game is over). Each of the Umihara Kawase games contains multiple routes through the fields and multiple final exits. Using shortcuts and optimised door routes can allow the game to be completed within minutes in the hands of a skilled player; however, enjoyment of the game typically lies not in merely making it to the first or easiest final exit door, but in exploring the game's many routes and mastering the challenging rope physics.  The Umihara Kawase games have simple controls. The protagonist is able to run, jump, climb onto ledges, climb ladders and, crucially, throw her fishing line. When thrown, the fishing line will hook onto nearly all surfaces within the games. When the line is firmly hooked onto a surface or an enemy fish the line is able to take her weight. From here Umihara is able to swing between platforms, lower herself down to other ledges and swing herself up to higher ledges. Due to the flexible nature of her line she can also catapult herself great distances by stretching the line to breaking point. The line can also be used to stun fish and reel them in, and once reeled in Umihara will store them in her rucksack and score points in doing so.  While the controls are simple and responsive, an uncompromising physics model means that graceful control of the game's swinging techniques will not come immediately. Out of this, though, comes great scope for advanced techniques through full utilization of the physics. Perfect execution of techniques such as the one- and two-step rocket jump are required both in later fields and for those who intend to improve their field completion times.  The games contain 1ups in the shape of Umihara's pink rucksack but no other collectibles are present.  "

1149,Undertale,/wiki/Undertale,Role-playing,8-4,8-4,"September 15, 2018","September 18, 2018",None," Undertale is a role-playing game that uses a top-down perspective. In the game, players control a child and complete objectives in order to progress through the story. Players explore an underground world filled with towns and caves, and are required to solve numerous puzzles on their journey. The underground world is the home of monsters, many of whom challenge the player in combat; players decide whether to kill, flee, or befriend them. Choices made by the player radically affect the plot and general progression of the game, with the player's morality acting as the cornerstone for the game's development.  When players encounter enemies in either scripted events or random encounters, they enter a battle mode. During battles, players control a small heart which represents their soul, and must avoid attacks unleashed by the opposing monster similar to a bullet hell shooter. As the game progresses, new elements are introduced, such as colored obstacles, and boss battles which change the way players control the heart. Players may choose to attack the enemy, which involves timed button presses. Killing enemies will cause the player to earn EXP (in turn increasing their LOVE) and gold. They can use the ACT option to perform various actions, which vary depending on the enemy. If the player uses the right actions to respond to the enemy, or attacks them until they have low HP (but still alive) they can choose to spare them and end the fight without killing them. For some boss encounters to be completed peacefully, the player is required to survive until the character they are facing has finished their dialogue. The game features multiple story branches and endings depending on whether players choose to kill or spare their enemies; and as such, it is possible to clear the game without killing a single enemy.  Monsters will talk to the player during the battle, and the game will tell the players what the monster's feelings and actions are. Enemy attacks change based on how players interact with them: should players choose non-violent options, enemy attacks are easy, whereas they become difficult if players choose violent options. The game relies on a number of metafictional elements in both its gameplay and story. When players participate in a boss battle on a second playthrough, the dialogue will be altered depending on actions in previous playthroughs.   Undertale takes place in the Underground, a realm to where monsters, once equal to humans, were banished after war broke out between them. The Underground is sealed from the surface world by an imperfect magic barrier, the only point of entry being at Mount Ebott. A human child falls into the Underground and encounters Flowey, a sentient flower who teaches them the game's mechanics and encourages them to raise their ""LV"", or ""LOVE"", by gaining ""EXP"" through killing monsters. When Flowey attempts to murder the human to take their soul for himself, the human is rescued by Toriel, a motherly goat-like monster, who teaches the human to solve puzzles and survive conflict in the Underground without killing. She intends to adopt the human, wanting to protect them from Asgore Dreemurr, the king of the Underground.  The human eventually leaves Toriel to search for Asgore's castle, which contains the barrier leading to the surface world. Along the way, the human encounters several monsters, including the skeletons Sans and Papyrus, two brothers who act as sentries for the Snowdin forest; Undyne, the head of the royal guard; Alphys, the kingdom's royal scientist; and Mettaton, a robotic television host Alphys created. Some of them are fought, with the human having to choose whether to kill them or to show mercy; should the human spare them, they may choose to become friends. During their travels, the human learns the cause of the war between humans and monsters. Asriel, the son of Asgore and Toriel, befriended the first human child who fell into the Underground and was adopted by Asgore and Toriel. One day, the child killed themselves by eating poisonous flowers. When Asriel returned their body to the humans, they attacked and fatally wounded him, resulting in Asgore declaring war. Asgore now seeks to break the barrier, which requires him to collect seven human souls, of which he has six.  The game's ending depends on how the player resolved encounters with monsters. If the player killed some but not all monsters, the human arrives at Asgore's castle and learns that they also need a monster's soul to cross the barrier, forcing them to fight Asgore. Sans stops the human before their confrontation, revealing that the human's ""LOVE"" is an acronym for ""level of violence"" and ""EXP"" for ""execution points."" Sans judges the human based on the combined resolution of the encounters. The human fights Asgore, but Flowey interrupts them, killing Asgore and stealing the human souls. With the aid of the rebelling souls, the human defeats Flowey, falls unconscious, and awakens on the human side of the barrier; they receive a phone call from Sans, explaining the state of the Underground after the human's departure.  If the player instead kills no monsters and has completed a previous playthrough of the game, Flowey is revealed to be a reincarnation of Asriel, created as part of Alphys's experiments. Toriel intervenes before the human fights Asgore and is joined by the other monsters the human has befriended. Flowey ambushes the group, using the souls of all the monsters to take an older Asriel's form to fight the human. The human connects with their new friends during the fight, eventually triumphing. Asriel reverts to his child form, destroys the barrier, and expresses his remorse to the others before leaving. The human falls unconscious and is awoken to see their friends surrounding them, with the knowledge of the human's name – Frisk. The monsters reintegrate with the humans on the surface, while Frisk has the option of accepting Toriel as their adoptive mother.  Another ending ensues if the player kills all monsters, in which Frisk becomes influenced by Chara, the fallen human child whose body Asriel attempted to return. When Frisk reaches Asgore's castle, Sans attempts to stop them, but Frisk kills him. Flowey kills Asgore in an attempt to get mercy, but Frisk executes Flowey anyway. The fallen human child assumes control and, with or without the player's consent, destroys the universe. To enable further replays of the game, Frisk must first give their soul to the fallen human child in exchange for restoring the universe, which will permanently alter every subsequent Pacifist run.

He encounters a blue Yarny among the shipwreck and the two connect their dead ends together, forming a bond. A spark emerges from the connection and the continuous objective of the game is to chase it. The two Yarnys explore the forest and the underground before emerging to ground level and taking residence in an abandoned lighthouse - the game's loading hub.  Chapter 2 -  Hideaway (in which we search for safety and companionship) The Yarnys enter the corridor of an adoption home where a young girl is attempting to escape abusive adults, and the Yarnys help her by using the spark to chase the adults off. A boy knocks on her bedroom window, and she escapes with him through the rooftop. The Yarnys follow the children through a small park, and the adults take the form of dark shadows with red sparks that disintegrate the Yarnys on touch.  Chapter 3 - Little Frogs (in which right is wrong, and we refuse to accept it) The Yarnys emerge in a sunny countryside setting in the midst of midsummer celebration, but as the children are mistreated by the intoxicated adults, the setting turns dark and threatening. The Yarnys run from the shadows and, along with the children, hide from the adults. They are chased through the forest by a wood grouse, narrowly escaping.  Chapter 4 - Nightswimming (in which night is bright as day, and we explore) As the children play and go swimming in the forest, the Yarnys explore the woods and are chased through a lake by a pike.  Chapter 5  - Is that all there is (in which the machine tries to grind us down) By nighttime, adults search for the children with flashlights and hounds in an old factory. The boy is caught and locked up, but later escapes when the Yarnys cause a machine to malfunction, causing a mayhem distracting the adults, and the children are reunited.

Chapter 6  - Ashes to ashes (in which we fall apart) A truckload of wooden logs crash onto an electrical fence, starting a forest fire that spreads to the buildings and stables. The girl rescues the boy from the fire when he is stuck in branches by a stream. The Yarnys struggle their way through, and the children are seen rescuing the stable horses from the fire before themselves running into safety.  Chapter 7 - At the rapids (in which we find strength, and light up the darkness) Initially, the Yarnys go through the ruins of the forest ravaged by wildfire, and go through an abandoned watermill, gradually making it active again, and they follow the water to the nearby rapids in a sunny setting. The children are seen pushing an adult into the current. In the final cutscene, the lighthouse is surrounded by dark spirits, but the spark chases them away and a group of Yarnys of various shapes and colors appear. Together they bring the spark to the center of the lighthouse and its light is restored, and the storm outside passes over.  The end credits state: “Love forms bonds between us, but not to hold us back. They’re meant to save us if we fall, or help us all climb higher. Yes, things break beyond repair sometimes, but we can always build anew. If our fire fades, it just takes a single spark to set it off again. No matter how dark things get, we can all help light the way. We can make this life beautiful, for ourselves and for each other.

Players assume the role of four characters: Frenchman Emile, his German son-in-law Karl, American soldier Freddie, and Belgian nurse Anna.  The game comprises four chapters split into several sections. Each section requires the player to clear an objective to progress through the story. Most of these involve solving puzzles by obtaining certain items needed for the situation. Other sections include wartime segments requiring the player to survive heavy gunfire, stealth sections where the player must avoid being detected by enemies, and rhythmic car chase sections set to classic songs. Each character can interact with objects, perform a melee attack to knock out guards or smash through debris, and throw projectiles. There are also some traits unique to each character. Emile has a shovel which lets him dig through soft ground, Freddie can cut through barbed wire, and Anna can treat patients for injuries, which requires the player to time button presses.  Players can issue various commands to a dog named Walt, who is able to squeeze into small areas, hold on to and fetch certain items, activate switches, and move around without being suspected by the enemy. The game features optional collectible items hidden in each segment, facts about the war that are unlocked as the game progresses, and a hint system the player can use if they are stuck on a section after a certain amount of time.   The story begins in the year 1914. The Austro-Hungarian Empire declares war on Serbia following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Through established alliances, Russia declares war on Austria-Hungary leading Germany to declare war on Russia in response. Anticipating war, France begins deporting German citizens. Karl, one of the deported Germans, is separated from his wife Marie and their son Victor, and drafted into the German army. Likewise, Marie's father and Karl's father-in-law Emile is drafted into the French army. After completing his training, Emile is thrown into combat during the Battle of the Frontiers. His unit is wiped out, and he is wounded, captured, and forced to cook for the Germans. His captor is Baron Von Dorf, who uses many advanced weapons like chlorine gas and zeppelins to defeat his foes. Karl recognizes Emile while serving under Von Dorf, but the Allies attack Von Dorf's camp and Karl is forced to flee. After he is rescued from the rubble by Walt, a German Army Doberman Pinscher, Emile escapes in the confusion and meets Freddie, an American who volunteered to join the French army after his wife was killed in a German bombing raid led by Von Dorf.  Freddie and Emile meet Anna, a Belgian veterinary student who doubles as a battlefield nurse. She is tracking Von Dorf since he is forcing her father to develop advanced war machines. The three chase Von Dorf's zeppelin from Ypres to Reims. When it crashes, Von Dorf escapes with Anna's father in a biplane. Karl survives the crash and is captured and taken as a prisoner of war. Anna accompanies Karl to the prison to make sure he recovers from his wounds.  Emile and Freddie continue their pursuit to exact revenge on Von Dorf and rescue Anna's father. They assault Fort Douaumont at Verdun where Von Dorf is hiding and capture his newest war machine, a large armoured tank. Although they rescue Anna's father, Von Dorf escapes again. While Emile is separated, Freddie continues his pursuit and finally corners Von Dorf during the Battle of the Somme, defeating him in a fist fight atop his ruined tank. Despite his desire for revenge, Freddie realizes he will not gain anything by killing Von Dorf and spares his life. For his repeated failures, Von Dorf is demoted and sent away from the front lines, a fate worse than death for the status-obsessed man.  Meanwhile, in a French prisoner of war camp, Karl learns his son is ill. Determined to reunite with his family, Karl escapes the camp. Emile believes he was killed while trying to escape. Karl encounters Anna, who helps drive him back to his farm at occupied Saint-Mihiel, but they are both captured by the Germans. Karl escapes when the Allies stage another assault that reaches his farm. He discovers it has been shelled with chlorine gas. Karl saves Marie's life by giving her his gas mask, but he succumbs to the gas. Anna arrives and saves Karl's life. When he recovers, Karl is finally reunited with his wife and son after three years of war and exile.  Back on the front lines, Emile is forced into the bloody and suicidal Nivelle Offensive. As his commanding officer constantly forces his troops into the line of fire and to their deaths, Emile finally reaches his breaking point and strikes the officer with his shovel, inadvertently killing him. He is court-martialed and sentenced to death by firing squad. In his final letter to Marie, Emile expresses his hatred of war, his grief at Karl's apparent death, and hopes that she and her family can find happiness. Emile is executed, and some time later, Karl and his family (with the newly adopted Walt in tow) visit his grave to mourn him. The story ends in 1917 when the United States officially enters the war and sends its army to Europe to fight on the Western Front.  "
1166,Valkyria Chronicles,/wiki/Valkyria_Chronicles_(video_game),Tactical role-playing,Sega,Sega,"September 27, 2018","October 16, 2018","October 16, 2018"," Valkyria Chronicles is a tactical role-playing game in which the player uses a unique turn-based battle system called BLiTZ (Battle of Live Tactical Zones). During their turn the player views an overhead map in Command Mode, but zooms in to control each individual unit on the battlefield in Action Mode. Movement and other actions are handled in real time during Action Mode, though limited in movement by an action point (AP) gauge that varies for each type of character. During Target Mode, the player is in direct control of characters' aim while the action freezes, allowing for head shots and other maneuvers. Taking command of individual units during the player's phase costs Command Points, which can be used dynamically to grant movement to many different units or the same unit consecutively with diminishing AP reserve, depending on what the player wants to accomplish. By using their troops the player must fulfill various conditions depending on the mission in order to achieve victory, most often the capture of a major enemy encampment. Upon completing missions, the player is awarded money and experience with which to upgrade their materiel and character classes, respectively, and the game's story is advanced. Missions can be failed if the player's forces are wholly incapacitated or killed, the squad's main battle tank is destroyed, or the player's main base camp is captured by the enemy.  Each character in the game fulfills a specific role — for instance, Alicia is a mid-range rifle-toting scout, while Welkin is a tank commander. Other roles include Shocktroopers (assault infantry), ""Lancers"" specializing in anti-tank warfare, snipers, and engineers. These various units form a rock-paper-scissors dynamic of strength and weakness. The foot soldiers (Scout, Shocktrooper, and Sniper) are effective against slower anti-tank units, anti-tank units can quickly destroy tanks with a well-aimed shot, and tanks are generally devastating against infantry, whose anti-personnel weapons are unable to inflict any significant frontal damage. While each character within a class is basically similar in terms of weaponry and statistics, each individual has a distinguishing set of Potentials: special abilities or stat modifiers triggered by various psychological or environmental factors in battle.  The environment also factors heavily in combat. In an urban level, for example, snipers can be sent onto rooftops to eliminate unsuspecting enemies below. Tanks can knock down walls and other obstacles to open new paths. Buildings and other structures offer hard cover around which to maneuver. Foliage offers soft cover to reduce the chance of being spotted by the enemy and to confound their aim when seen. As the Gallian forces advance across the battlefield, control points can be captured, giving the player a tactical advantage and offering additional locations in which to call reinforcements. As Welkin, the player can issue various Orders for the purpose of things such as artillery strikes, supervising medics, and improving offensive or defensive capabilities of various characters.   In 1935 E.C., the continent of Europa is dominated by two superpowers: The Autocratic East Europan Imperial Alliance in the east and a commonwealth of loosely allied democracies known as the Atlantic Federation in the west. The economies of both powers depend on a precious multipurpose mineral called Ragnite. Its growing scarcity results in the Empire declaring war on the Federation, sparking the Second Europan War. The Empire uses its military superiority to quickly put the Federation on the defensive. Emboldened by their progress and momentum, the Empire decides to invade the neutral Principality of Gallia to seize its rich Ragnite deposits.  When Imperial forces launch an attack on the Gallian border town of Bruhl, Welkin Gunther, son of the country's hero General Belgen Gunther, is forced to fight for his life alongside the town watch captain, Alicia Melchiott. Together with Welkin's adopted sister Isara and using Belgen's prototype tank from the first war, the Edelweiss, they escape to the capital city of Randgriz and join the Gallian militia. Welkin is promoted to the rank of Lieutenant and assumes command of the newly formed Squad 7, with Alicia acting as his non-commissioned officer. Members of the squad initially question Welkin's qualifications due to a lack of combat experience. He quickly gains their trust and loyalty, however, with his brilliant tactics. Welkin and Alicia soon become romantically engaged, but tragically, Isara is killed by an Imperial sniper.  After Squad 7 wages a successful campaign against Imperial forces, the crown prince Maximilian deploys one of his commanders, Selvaria Bles, a rare descendant of the Valkyrians who are believed to have saved the ancient world from the Darcsen race. Using innate magic powers and equipped with a legendary Ragnite lance and shield, Selvaria destroys the Gallian army. Alicia is shot by Welkin's archaeologist colleague Faldio Landzaat to awaken her own latent Valkyrian powers. Alicia is able to drive Selvaria back, allowing the Gallians to advance to the border. At the cost of her own life, Selvaria uses the ""final flame"" after the capture of the Ghirlandaio fortress, killing the entire core of Gallian military and leaving only the militia, such as Squad 7, remaining.  In an attempt to create his own empire, Maximilian uses a ""land dreadnought"", the Marmota, to break through Gallia's defenses and steal a giant Valkyrian lance from inside Randgriz Castle. The princess reveals herself to be Darcsen - the Valkyrians rewrote history to make themselves into heroes, while an allied Darcsen tribe gained Randgriz as the spoils. With Alicia's help, Squad 7 is able to board the Marmota and send Maximilian to his demise, destroying the dreadnought and ending the conflict between the two factions. Alicia and Welkin return to Bruhl, where they marry and raise a daughter named Isara together.  "

It introduces a new soldier class known as the Grenadier, who can fire mortar rounds at enemies. If allied soldiers are present to provide battlefield information, they can fire without being seen by hostile forces. When a soldier in your army is on the verge of death, there is a fixed chance that a new system called ""Brave"" will be activated. When used, players can choose to either restore one Command Point (CP) and increase the ability of a nearby ally, counter the enemy's attack (if downed on enemy's turn) or restore Action Points (AP) to the unit and enable it to move and attack once in an invincible state (if downed on player's turn).   Claude Wallace and his childhood friends Kai Shulen and Raz join the Federation Army in order to fight the Empire in the Second Europan War, both to protect their home country of Gallia and avenge an Imperial attack on their hometown of Hafen. However, during training, Kai mysteriously disappears, leaving his sister Leena to take his place as ""Kai"". Claude, Raz, and Leena are able to pass training and join the elite Ranger Corps, with Claude being assigned command of Squad E.   Squad E is then informed that the Empire has the upper hand, capturing a large amount of Federation territory as well as initiating an invasion of Gallia. Federation leaders decide to put all of their resources into Operation Northern Cross, a massive offensive with the objective of pushing straight to the Imperial capital of Schwartzgrad. The operation is initially successful, with Squad E managing to push through Imperial territory. Along the way, they are joined by another childhood friend, Riley Miller. Riley is initially mistrustful of Claude due to him running away from a fire that killed Riley's family, but eventually accepts his command when he proves his worth as a leader. Squad E continues the offensive by breaking the Siegval Line, Schwartzgrad's final line of defense. Along the way, they battle the elite Imperial tank unit Ausbruch, led by Klaus Walz, who considers Claude a worthy rival. However, despite the Federation's early success, winter comes earlier than expected, halting the unprepared Federation forces. Crippled by the snow and cold and weakened by stretched supply lines, the Federation forces are quickly routed by a massive Imperial counterattack. Squad E is forced to flee to the coast, where they are rescued by a trio of highly advanced Federation snow cruisers; massive warships that can travel over the ice of the Crystal Sea.  After coming aboard one of the cruisers, the Centurion, Claude is assigned by Captain Morgen to protect the warship as the fleet carries out Operation Cygnus, a contingency plan to attack Schwartzgrad from the sea in case Operation Northern Cross failed. Meanwhile, Walz is assigned to X-0, an elite Imperial science unit led by Lord Heinrich Belgar. Belgar tasks Walz with intercepting and capturing the Federation fleet, and teams him up with his chief strategic officer, Forseti and the Valkyria Crymaria. Forseti leads an attack on the fleet, prompting Squad E to respond, but Crymaria intervenes against Forseti's orders, and she loses control of her powers, destroying one of the cruisers and heavily damaging the Centurion before it escapes. Forseti is furious since their mission was to capture the cruisers intact, and he reveals to Walz that he has planted his sister as a spy aboard the Centurion in order to track its movements. Walz then witnesses how Crymaria is mistreated by her handlers and begins to show her compassion.  Meanwhile, the crew of the Centurion tries to repair the damage to their ship, but its main reactor has been knocked offline, forcing the ship to run at a fraction of its speed on the backup engine. At the same time, Riley finds a young amnesiac girl named Angie in the engine room, and the crew assumes her to be a stowaway. Squad E begins to take a liking to Angie as she befriends everybody. During a raid on an Imperial supply base, Angie sneaks ashore and meets Crymaria, who realizes Angie is a Valkyria as well. It is also revealed that Forseti is the real Kai, now working for the Empire and manipulating Leena into spying for him. Leena decides to cut ties with Forseti, declaring her brother dead. Claude then receives word that the third ship in the fleet is under attack. Despite knowing it is a trap, Squad E attempts to rescue the ship, but it self destructs, creating a massive explosion. Knowing that the Centurion can't escape the blast unless at full speed, Angie places herself inside the reactor, revealing herself to be the power source. Captain Morgen is wounded during the fighting and reveals the true scope of Operation Cygnus to Claude. The reactors that power the snow cruisers use energy given off by Valkyria placed inside them. In addition, the reactors also double as weapons dubbed the ""A2 bomb"", powerful enough to destroy an entire city. Operation Cygnus' true objective isn't to invade Schwartzgrad, but completely destroy it with the A2 bomb.   Claude is placed in command of the Centurion and he reluctantly proceeds with the mission. Walz and Crymaria attempt to stop him but are defeated. Crymaria loses control of her powers again after believing Walz was killed, but he appears and helps calm her down, promising her that they will live a happy life together after the war. The Centurion continues towards Schwartzgrad but is caught in a trap. Raz sacrifices himself to disable the trap and the ship continues on, plowing into the center of Schwartzgrad. Forseti boards the ship, intent on rescuing Angie since he had previously been part of the secret Federation program to acquire Valkyria for the reactor experiments, and his guilt motivated him to defect to the Empire. Leena shoots and kills Forseti before he can reach the reactor. Claude then prepares to detonate the A2 bomb, but the Empire offers a ceasefire to the Federation, ending the war with no clear victor. Belgar ignores the ceasefire and attacks the Centurion, obsessed with seizing its reactor and perfecting the technology. Squad E is able to defeat and kill Belgar, but the Centurion is severely damaged and begins to sink. Claude is able to narrowly rescue Angie and Riley from the sinking ship.   Afterwards, the Second European War comes to an end with neither the Federation nor Empire achieving a decisive victory, but everybody is glad to see peace return. Walz lives happily with Crymaria at his side. Squad E disbands and the survivors pursue their own interests while Claude, Riley, Leena, and Angie return to Hafen to live in peace.  "

In addition to the game's main quest, the player has access to side quests and loyalty quests; the latter involves creating bonds to the characters in their party (""coterie"").

1172,Vampyr,/wiki/Vampyr_(video_game),Action role-playing,Focus Home Interactive,Dontnod Entertainment,Unreleased,"October 29, 2019","October 29, 2019"," Vampyr is an action role-playing game played from a third-person view. The player controls Jonathan E. Reid, a doctor who was made into a vampire, and whose thirst for blood compels him to kill innocent people. To do this successfully, he must gather information about his targets—study and change their habits, collect clues, and maintain relationships by communicating with the sixty citizens under his care in London, which serves as a fictionalised semi-open world built around hubs of neighbourhoods tethered to other areas. A skill tree facilitates the improvement of abilities, which is fuelled by experience points gained from blood and, alternatively, investigation. Feeding on human blood provides nourishment in addition to unlocking new vampiric powers. Abilities can be manually activated and passively upgraded. Active skills afford defensive, aggressive, healing, and tactical measures; passive skills increase health, stamina, the blood gauge and absorption, bite damage and regeneration, and carry capacity.  If one so chooses, anyone can be targeted, bearing consequences for London. It is possible to finish the game without killing citizens, which best preserves Reid's cover as a doctor, but leaves him nearly incapable of levelling up. Killing no one unlocks one of four endings. He can turn people into vampires, and is only able to enter a house with an invitation. Locals each have their different backgrounds, relationships, and routines. If killed, they impart their last thought. The ""Mesmerise"" ability controls the behaviour of weaker targets, like coercing them into revealing information, or guiding them to less conspicuous areas so as to feed without combat. With crafted medicine, Reid can heal the injured and sick, whom if eaten, will yield more experience points as a result; the rate of their affliction can be viewed using vampire senses, which also detect blood. Each of the four districts has a score based on the average health of its citizens. Reid navigates London using a waypoint, and collectible documents are scattered around the city.  Reid can wield improvised melee weapons, such as a saw, as well as ranged weapons including the Webley Revolver. Being able to use three-hit combos, dodge rolls, and parrying, he can fight against other vampires like him—aristocrats who go by the name of Ekon; sewer-dwelling vampires known as Skals; the Vulkod—a stronger breed of vampire resembling werewolves; Nemrod—vampires who hunt their own kind; and the Guard of Priwen—a secret society of vampire slayers. Boss fights are featured, and in some cases mandatory. Reid is adaptable to other vampire features, like the claws of a Vulkod. Weapon improvement through crafting is made possible by looting items. While using vampiric powers in combat, the character's blood bar drains. This forces him to feed so he can immediately replenish his strength. With the vitality attained from killing a human being, he can boil the blood of his enemies, cast blood spears, throw mist bombs, and turn invisible. He uses his control of shadows to hide himself and strike at his opponents. He can use ""Spring"" to scale locations otherwise out of reach and charge more rapidly across gaps, which is also useful for avoiding combat altogether.   Doctor Jonathan Reid, returning to London from the Great War in 1918, awakes in a mass grave as a vampire. Overwhelmed with bloodlust, he causes the death of his sister Mary, who was searching for his body nearby. Reid takes shelter from vampire hunters in an abandoned house and starts hearing the disembodied voice of his maker, a typical feature in the progeny of vampires. Realising London is profuse with corpses, he follows a blood trail to a bar. The bartender points Reid to William Bishop, a suspicious patron. Bishop is caught feeding on a man named Sean Hampton and is killed by the vampire Lady Ashbury. Doctor Edgar Swansea rescues Hampton and hires Reid to practice medicine at Pembroke Hospital.  After the room of patient Harriet Jones is found covered in blood and Hampton disappears, Reid tracks him down for questioning. Hampton insists he did not murder Jones and directs him to an underground haven for corrupted vampires known as Skals, where it is revealed that Jones faked her death. Reid later discovers a corpse in the street bearing his mother's brooch. He pursues the perpetrator towards the cemetery in Whitechapel and finds his sister Mary with their mother Emelyne, realising Mary was turned into a vampire the night he fed on her. Mary is intent on killing him to rid herself of his voice, but dies trying. Reid vows to uncover what is behind the Skal epidemic, which he learns has been mistaken for the Spanish flu.  Lady Ashbury invites Reid to the West End on behalf of the Ascalon Club, a secret society of highborn vampires. By the order of its leader Lord Redgrave, Reid roots out the source of Skals in the district. Swansea is later kidnapped and, once located, admits to attempting to heal Jones with Lady Ashbury's blood, thereby creating the Skal epidemic; once Ashbury finds out, she flees in shame. It is made known that the entity Myrddin, claimant to the role of Jonathan's maker, sired him to defeat his mother Morrigan, also known as the ""Red Queen"", after she possessed Jones to wreak havoc upon London. Reid defeats Morrigan in battle, resolving then to travel after Lady Ashbury to her family castle, where she hid with her maker William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke.  "
1173,The Vanishing of Ethan Carter,/wiki/The_Vanishing_of_Ethan_Carter,Adventure,Astronauts,Astronauts,Unreleased,"August 15, 2019","August 15, 2019"," The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is set in an open world environment, in which the player can roam around and explore at will; in its opening the game notes that it ""does not hold  hand"", and as such features very little by way of explanation to the mechanics.  To piece together the story, the player must solve the deaths of the Carter family. Upon finding a dead body, the player can use paranormal abilities in order to recreate the events: first it must sense where important objects are located and restore the scene to its original state, and then reassemble the timeline of events tied to a certain death.  The game also features additional ""stories"" that must be fully uncovered for the game to receive its final ending; some of these are puzzles, others are more akin to a stealth game which cause the game to be over if the player fails.   In 1973, paranormal investigator Paul Prospero receives a fan letter from 12-year-old Ethan Carter, inspiring him to journey to Ethan's hometown of Red Creek Valley, Wisconsin. Upon arrival, he learns Ethan has gone missing and begins encountering unsettling paranormal phenomena, as well as evidence of recent violence in the tiny mining village.  As his investigation progresses, Prospero learns the Carter family's dark secret: Ethan had released a malevolent spirit known as the Sleeper through witchcraft, threatening their lives. When his uncle Chad and mother Missy tried to sacrifice him to appease the Sleeper, Ethan escaped with the help of his father Dale; Missy then killed Chad when he attacked Dale, and Dale later killed Missy. Dale then committed suicide in an effort to not become a vessel of the Sleeper as Ethan's older brother Travis now was. Travis turns on Ethan, forcing his grandfather Ed to kill Travis. Ethan and Ed try to destroy the Sleeper's chambers, but Ed traps Ethan inside the chamber and waits to die outside as Ethan sets a fire within. Prospero finds Ethan, but he suddenly vanishes after they both realise Prospero was too late.  If Prospero has uncovered all of Ethan's stories around the world, then using an elaborate mural created by Ethan, Prospero discovers that he is in fact a figment of Ethan's imagination. The cult of the Sleeper was an invention, as were the deaths of the family members during Prospero's investigation. Ethan had built a sanctuary inside a mansion in town to escape his family, particularly his overbearing mother, and abusive brother and uncle. When his mother accidentally sets the mansion on fire, trapping Ethan in the room with no way to save himself, he summons Prospero to provide comfort as he's consumed by the smoke by enacting a fictitious series of events. Having fulfilled his purpose, Prospero tells Ethan to let go, and that a new story awaits before both of them fade from the world.  "

Tap notes must be tapped when they reach the horizontal line to make them disappear. Hold notes are long notes that must be held on until the note ends. Swipe notes must be swiped in a specific direction to make them disappear, while slide notes require the player to hold their finger on the horizontal line and slide it to where the next white note will fall to so the note can disappear.  A score is given based on the performance of how accurate each note is hit. The accuracy of each note is judged by either as 'Max Perfect', 'Perfect', 'OK' or 'Miss'. The total score will also show a letter grade: an S rating from 950,000 points or when player receives a title, an A rating from 880,000 points, a B rating from 780,000 points, and a C rating for any lower score. There is a combo counter which keeps count of how many notes have been hit without missing.

Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character sprites. The game follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.  There are four main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each heroine. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. Some decisions can lead the game to end prematurely, which offer an alternative ending to the plot.

The player can examine and interact with characters and items, and must make use of inventory items and the environment. Throughout the game, the player is presented with the ability to interact with their surroundings, and options to determine the nature of that interaction. For example, the player may be able to look at a character, talk to that character, or if they are carrying an item, offer it to the character or ask them about it. According to Robert Kirkman, The Walking Dead game is focused more on developing characters and story, and less on the action tropes that tend to feature in other zombie-based games, such as Left 4 Dead.  Some parts of the game require timed responses from the player, often leading to significant decisions that will impact the game's story, in the manner of role-playing games (RPGs). Some conversation trees require the player to make a selection within a limited time, otherwise Lee will remain quiet, which can affect how other characters respond to him. Unlike in other RPGs such as the Mass Effect or Fallout series, where choices fall on either side of a ""good or evil"" scale, the choices within The Walking Dead have ambiguous results, having an effect on the attitude of the non-player characters towards Lee. The player can opt to enable a ""choice notification"" feature, in which the game's interface indicates that a character has changed their disposition towards Lee as a result of these choices. In more action-based sequences, the player must follow on-screen prompts for quick time events (QTEs) so as to keep themselves or other characters alive. If the player dies, the game restarts from just prior to the QTE. Other timed situations involve major decisions, such as choosing which of two characters to keep alive.  Each episode contains five points where the player must make a significant decision, choosing from one of two available options. Through Telltale's servers, the game tracks how many players selected which option and lets the player compare their choices to the rest of the player base. The game can be completed regardless of what choices are made in these situations; the main events of the story, as described below, will continue regardless of what choices are made, but the presence and behavior of the non-player characters in later scenes will be affected by these choices. The game does allow the player to make multiple saves, and includes a ""rewind"" feature where the player can back up and alter a previous decision, thus facilitating the exploration of alternative choices.

The player, in control of Clementine, can direct the character around the environment, examine and interact with various scenery elements and collect and use objects to advance the story. The player can also initiate conversations with non-player characters via conversation trees. Certain replies from other characters may offer the player multiple choices to select from, including the option to stay silent, with a limited amount of time to make the selection; if the player does not select an option, the conversation will continue as if they had stayed quiet. Such choices can affect how the other characters will later react to Clementine which can influence later events in the story.  Other scenes are more action-oriented, requiring the player to complete quick time events to prevent Clementine or her allies from getting killed. If the player fails at these events, the game will restart at the start of the scene. Such action scenes may also require the player to make a key decision within a limited time frame, such as which of two characters to save from attacking walkers.  The player's choices and actions will impact story elements in later episodes; for example, a character that the player does not choose to save will not appear in later scenes. Season Two also incorporates the player's choices from the first season and the DLC 400 Days, via the saved game file from these games, to influence the story and events in these episodes.  "
1188,Wandersong,/wiki/Wandersong,Puzzle,Greg Lobanov,Humble Bundle,Unreleased,"September 27, 2018","September 27, 2018"," Wandersong is a side-scrolling puzzle and adventure game that uses music as a puzzle-solving mechanic. The player character can sing to cause events to occur in the environment around them, using a coloured ""song wheel"" with eight directions, each representing musical notes spanning an octave, which is controlled by the mouse on a computer setup, or the right thumbstick on a controller. Certain challenges in the game involve the player matching notes or tunes with a non-player character's song, similar to a typical rhythm game. Functions that allow the player to perform dances also exist, but do not actually serve a purpose in gameplay. Wandersong is set in a universe created by a goddess named Eya who ""sang the universe into existence."" Every epoch, Eya sings a brand new song that destroys the universe and creates a new one. The player character, known as The Bard, makes an attempt to gather the pieces of the ""Earthsong"", a composition that, when sung, will allow the universe to be preserved. The game is estimated to be 11 hours in length.   The game is broken up into a prologue and then seven acts, each with a variety of ""scenes"" in them.  In the prologue, the main character, a bard is having a dream. He sees a sword and tried to pick it up to fight a monster, but ultimately fails. He sees the messenger of the god, Eya, and she tells him that the world is ending, and that he didn't pass the test and isn't ""The Hero.""  In Act One, the bard wakes up from his dream near the town of Langtree. when he arrives at Langtree, he finds many different ghosts are haunting it, but he can calm them down with his singing. From the oldest woman of the village, Ruby, he learns the Overseer Song which will enable him to visit the overseer, a minor god and protector of a certain area. He then tries to go meet with the Dream King, the overseer of Langtree, and while in the spirit world sees the messenger again, who tells him about the Earthsong, a legendary song which he can gather from different pieces given by all the Overseers of the world which might be able to save the world. The Dream King doesn't give him the part of the song he has, but does give the bard the ability to communicate with other Overseers and ghosts. He returns to Langtree and finishes saving them from the ghosts, now able to communicate with them. He finds they're all their dead relatives  In Act Two, the bard meets Miriam and her grandmother Sapphy, who are witches. Sapphy sends Miriam, a loner who is constantly frustrated by the bard's singing, to assist him in saving the world by collecting the pieces of the Earthsong. They go through a cave of trolls, and find that one of them had a curse cast upon them by an evil human. The bard tries to break the curse with singing but doesn't succeed. They then arrive at the neighboring town of Delphi. There the bard meets Manny, a drummer who's trying to put together a band, and gathers the band members of Ash and Viola. They all perform and are wildly successful. Ash then comes out and performs the Overseer song. The bard then goes through the spirit world and gets the Queen of Winds' part of the Earthsong. The bard then returns to the troll-cave and frees the cursed troll, before setting sail on the ocean.  In Act Three, the bard and Miriam are sailing on a ship of coffee-trading pirates. They meet Captain Lucas, who wants to try and find the mermaids who disappeared a long time ago. A fortune teller tells the bard that the mermaids know the Overseer song. One of the crew members, Markus, captures and imprisons the whole crew, but the bard manages to talk him out of it. The bard and Captain Lucas then find and meet the mermaids, who decide to return as long as Captain Lucas stays calm, and gives the bard the Overseer song. He visits the spirit world and sees the Queen Chaos, but before he can get the overseer song she is killed by Audrey Redheart, the Hero. Despite that, he obtains the Earthsong piece from her dead body, being able to talk to ghosts.  In the Intermission, the user briefly plays as The Hero who kills the Queen of Winds, another Overseer.  In Act Four, the bard is depressed and wakes up in his mothers house in the town of Chimest. Everyone in the town is sad because they're all forced to work in the factory or with an extension of the factory, run by The Baron, and what it produces, Happy Kid dolls. Miriam figured out the Overseer song and how to access the spirit world, but is unable to because of the pollutants from the factory. He teams up with the local astronomer and gathers a team of Winston and Peter, who has fallen in love with Miriam, though she does not reciprocate the love. Together the four of them take down the factory, and go see The Baron, who truly wanted to make everyone in the world happy by making the Happy Kid dolls, but didn't realize he was simply making everyone miserable. The factory shuts down and people are a lot happier. The bard then goes into the spirit world and finds that Queen Order isn't sitting on her throne, as the Dream King is on it, trying to avoid The Hero, who is killing Overseers. The Hero kills Queen Order, but the Dream King escapes. From communicating with Queen Order's spirit the bard learns the next part of the song.  In Act Five, there is a war between two neighboring kingdoms, Rulle and Chaandesh. The citizens of Rulle all have spirit pets, and the citizens of Chaandesh are all witches. Giant monsters are appearing and terrorizing the inhabitants of both nations. A ghost gives the bard a message to deliver to the King of Rulle, and as such the bard and Miriam head to Xiatian, the capitol city. Along the way they save a near-empty town called Lumber Town, inhabited only by the infirm and elderly who were unable to make the journey to the capitol, from a swarm of monsters. There they sing a song about a wayfarer who comes across a witch and they fall in love, but the witch curses the wayfarer and steals her soul, although they are in love, showing the distrust of witches by Rulle citizens, but also slightly reflecting the bard and Miriam's relationship, which causes Miriam to be sad. When they arrive at Xiatian, the find the hero has already arrived and is idolized by the town for defeating giant monsters and saving the city. They realize that in order to meet the King they have to go with the Hero, who lets them come along as long as they provide her with a potion of strength. Miriam cooks up a possibly faulty potion of strength, but gives it to her regardless as she dislikes the Hero. When they see the King, he reveals they're going to invade Chaandesh in three days. The ghost inside the bard sings a message imploring him to seek peace, before the bard passes out. When he wakes up Miriam is flying him across the border and reveals that they were thrown in prison there, and are now going to the nexus point in order to access the spirit world. Miriam plays the Overseer song on her piccolo, but the messenger reveals that there is a second part, held by the queen of Chaandesh. They then fly over the border, but are knocked down by magic from ""the Spell Squad"", a defense force against the monster consisting of two witches, Vivian and Sandra. The bard and Miriam team up with them to fight some monsters, and they then put them on a boat which will take them to the capital city, Mohabumi. On the boat the bard learns that the spirit inhabiting him is Hala, a deceased Chaandesh princess. He also puts on a performance with the musicians there. The capital city is inside a mountain, and on account that everyone inhabiting it is a witch, requires magic to get around. The bard learns that magic is just a form of singing, and uses that to be able to cast very primal spells to get around the city. There the bard sees the band from Delphi, who are ecstatic to see him, and are putting on a performance with a new singer. While at the concert Miriam reveals she always felt out of place and lonely being a witch, and expected to feel accepted here, but doesn't as much as she thought. She says that she's just going to dance and be herself for a bit. The bard goes to see the Queen and Hala makes an appeal to her to stop the fighting, as it's all a misunderstanding. The Queen rebuffs them, but Purnima, one of Hala's sisters, teaches them the Overseer song. The bard and Miriam enter the spirit world, but are separated, and find things are in disarray, and the spirit world is being pulled together and is collapsing. The Hero shows up and knocks out Miriam. The two Overseers then fight and destroy each other. In the aftermath of that the bard learns two parts of the song from their spirits, and following that the spirit world ends. Having carried Miriam out of the spirit world, the bard sings a song to both nations, bringing them together and making them understand one another, ending the war. Miriam was badly injured by the Hero and decides she is unable to go on, instead she will return to see her grandmother as the end of the world draws nearer. The bard continues on alone.  In Act Six, the bard climbs Ichor Mountain, at the top of which is the King of Hearts. Along the way he finds the Heart of Eya Temple, with some monks remaining in it, awaiting the world's end. With the help of bird, bugs, and flying seals the bard makes it up to the top of the mountain. At the top he finds the King of Hearts has been overtaken by darkness. The Hero shows up, attempting to kill it, but drinks the defective strength potion and is weakened. Both the Hero and the bard are knocked out back to a cave partway down the mountain, and the Hero loses her sword. There, with the help of the bugs the bard befriended earlier, they make it out of the cave, but the bard makes Audrey promise not to kill the King of Hearts. They find the King of Hearts again, and the Hero finds her sword and kills him, breaking her promise. The bard gets the Earthsong from his body before returning to Langtree.  In Act Seven, the bard returns to Langtree to find that it is unrecognizable, nearly completely destroyed with all the citizens awaiting the world's end. He reencounters Miriam, who says she feels bad for leaving him. Miriam now fully accepts and is happy with her friendship with the bard. The two reunite and set off for the Dream Castle, which is not completely in the real world after the spirit world collapsed. They reencounter the Dream King who reveals to them that the end isn't going to happen soon, but is happening, and that the end is the people moving apart from one another and everyone losing hope. He says that the Earthsong can't stop that, and only something that unites everyone in harmony can do that. He says their quest is hopeless. Suddenly, the Hero appears and tries to strike down the Dream King. The bard and Miriam work together to stop the Hero from killing her, with Miriam finally stealing her sword. The Hero tells them that she was chosen and she was the special one, and she has to do this because she is the Hero. The bard tries to convince her otherwise, saying she would be special no matter what. Regardless, the Hero uses her scarf to reclaim her sword and kills the Dream King. The world becomes entirely black and white, but a bell rings out in the darkness. The bard sings, reaching out with his voice to everyone across the world, and everyone responds in harmony. The world returns to color and is saved. The messenger tells them that the bard didn't sing the Earthsong, but sang something different yet also special, which united everyone in the world and harmonized with Eya's song, saving the world. Miriam then takes the bard all around the world to all different parts of his journey to reunite with his friends. Finally, he returns to Langtree where he has dinner with Sapphy and Miriam. The bard says to Miriam although it's goodbye for now, they still will be friends. They hug each other, and then the bard goes home.  "

1190,Warframe,/wiki/Warframe,Third-person shooter,Digital Extremes,Digital Extremes,"November 21, 2018","November 20, 2018","November 20, 2018"," Warframe is an online action game that includes elements of shooters, RPG, and stealth games. The player creates their Tenno character, which includes a basic armor unit called a ""Warframe"" which provides the player with special abilities, basic weapons such as a melee weapon, primary, sidearm(s), and a ship. Through the ship's console, the player can select any of the available missions to them. A main storyline set of missions requires players to complete certain missions across planets and moons in the solar system, to be able to access junctions that they can progress to other planets or locations. Other missions rotate over time as part of the game's living universe; these can include missions with special rewards and community challenges to allow all players to reap benefits if they are successfully met. Aboard the ship, the player can also manage all other functions for their Tenno, including managing their arsenal of equipment, customizing their Warframe and weapons, crafting new equipment, and access the in-game store.  Missions can be played alone or with up to four players in a player versus environment cooperative manner. Each mission is given a ranking that indicates how difficult the mission is. Missions are generally played on randomly generated maps composed of ""tiles"" of map sections. Missions have various objectives, such as defeating a certain number of enemies, collecting data from terminals without activating alarms, rescuing prisoners, or defending points on the map for set periods of time. Newer updates have added space-bound combat using Archwings, space equipment which come with a new set of abilities and weapons, and a large open-field environment where numerous bounties can be completed. Players can use their weapons, special abilities, and a number of parkour style moves to navigate through and overpower forces within these missions. Downed players may choose to revive themselves up to a maximum of six times, or can be revived by other players an infinite number of times. Once complete, players are rewarded with in-game items, as well as in-game currency and items picked up while exploring the map; failure to complete a mission causes these rewards to be lost. In addition to cooperative missions, the game includes player versus player (PvP) content through the multiplayer ""Conclave"", which also rewards the player for placing high in such matches.  Players and their equipment also gain experience and level up from missions; equipment with higher levels can do more damage and support more ""mods"", special cards that can be slotted into the equipment to change its attributes or provide passive bonuses and abilities. Mods are dropped by enemies during missions and may be part of the rewards, and are generally given out following a rarity distribution, with more powerful mods being more elusive to acquire. Alongside mods, players have other means of improving their equipment, including conditional upgrades called Arcane Enhancements and Riven Mods, weapon-exclusive mods whose weapon, buffs and stats are determined upon unlocking. Another type of reward is equipment blueprints, which can be used to construct new Warframe parts or weapons; blueprints and their resulting equipment may also be purchased directly using in-game money called Platinum. Players need to have specific quantities of construction materials (found from missions and their rewards) to build these items.  Warframe is designed to be free-to-play, and has avoided using any pay to win elements; all Warframes, weapons, and other equipment is possible to acquire in-game over time through grinding, though monetization can simplify the process.  New weapons, Warframes, equipment, blueprints to construct such equipment and cosmetics like skins and capes (called Syandanas) can be purchased in the market, using either Credits, which are earned in-game, or Platinum, a premium currency that can be traded for with other players for rare items in-game or be purchased via microtransactions. Platinum is also required to purchase additional enhancements, such as arsenal slots for Warframes and weapons, as well as items that enhance the mod capacity of gear.  Though, there are some cosmetic items that can only be obtained through in-game payments.  Late in 2019, an update named Empyrean was introduced to the game letting players pilot and manage a space ship called a Railjack. This was designed as a co-op experience with up to four people working together, doing different jobs to keep the ship operational while destroying enemy ships. In early 2020 a new Intrinsic is going to be released called Command which will make solo play more accessible.  "

There is also an overworld editor for linking different missions together; this can let the player create branching paths and set missions to unlock under certain conditions.  "
1195,Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate,/wiki/Warriors_Orochi_3_Ultimate,Hack and slash,Omega Force,Koei Tecmo,"November 9, 2017",Unreleased,Unreleased," The gameplay of Warriors Orochi 3 is similar to that of the two titles that the Warriors Orochi 3 takes its characters from: namely Dynasty Warriors 7 (specifically, Dynasty Warriors Next) and Samurai Warriors 3. Characters from either of these series play similar to how they play in their respective source games, but with a number of changes to unify the two different games together, including:  For characters who are from neither of the two series, whether or not the character is of Japanese origin determines whether their Musou attack corresponds to that of the Dynasty Warriors or the Samurai Warriors cast. Characters new to Warriors Orochi also have movesets based on their overall character type in this regard: for example, some of non-Japanese origin characters like Nemea, whose moveset is based on a Dynasty Warriors 7 weapon unused by anyone in that roster, have an EX attack like Dynasty Warriors characters, while some of Japanese-origin characters like Kaguya has the longer, standard attack chain reminiscent of a character from the Samurai Warriors roster.  takes place on modified versions of stages taken primarily from Dynasty Warriors 7 or Samurai Warriors 3 (in addition, some downloadable content and story elements in Ultimate take place in stages taken from Warriors Orochi 2); a select number of stages relevant to the story are new stages. Each of the new ""collaboration characters"" (Ryu Hayabusa, Ayane, Joan of Arc, Nemea, Achilles, Rachel, Momiji, Kasumi, Sterkenburg, and Sophitia) is also associated with a stage taken from either Dynasty Warriors 7 or Samurai Warriors 3, with graphical modifications made to resemble their game of origin. Much of the stage music is taken from earlier Dynasty Warriors, Samurai Warriors, or Warriors Orochi games; each of the collaboration characters is also associated with a unique theme.  New mechanics for the Warriors Orochi series include:   Several years after the events of Warriors Orochi 2, the warriors of the Three Kingdoms era of China and the Sengoku period of Japan have begun to rebuild their lives in the twisted dimensional world after Orochi's permanent death. The peace is not to last for long though, as a monstrous eight-headed serpent beast known as Hydra appears and massacres the warriors. Combined with the resurrection of Kiyomori Taira and the reappearance of Da Ji, who brainwashes the remaining heroes, the warriors are left in shambles. The remaining three heroes – Ma Chao, Sima Zhao, and Hanbei Takenaka – are about to be defeated if not for the intervention of the Moon Princess, Kaguya, who claims to have been sent from the mystic world to help the warriors. She uses her time travel ability to send the three back in time, so they will be able to save their comrades from certain doom.  After securing the more strategic places like Odawara Castle, the coalition are informed by mystic Taigong Wang that they can defeat the Hydra using a special weapon called ""Yashio'ori""; however, they will need the time and power to build such a weapon. The coalition capture an amnesiac mighty warrior, Shuten Dōji, who is later revealed to be an offshoot of Orochi who was born at the same time as Hydra; in reality, he is the world's will of Orochi's power, as well as Da Ji herself, who reluctantly joins after the coalition have her friend, Himiko as an unwitting hostage. Because of the time required to build multiple Yashio'ori, the coalition have to return to the distant past when the Hydra had yet to appear in the world, which they fulfill through Da Ji's power, as she has been in the dimensional world the entire time (the other mystics have only appeared when the Hydra had made its appearance). Upon arriving, the coalition have to protect Da Ji from the anti-Orochi forces as well as an army of mystics led by Susanoo, who has dedicated his job to hunt Da Ji. They eventually gain their trust, and with the help of them, the coalition build multiple Yashio'ori powered by Shuten Dōji's essence, while also preparing for the upcoming grand battle with the Hydra.  In the final chapter, the coalition confront the Hydra again, who is defeated with the help of Yashio'ori. The Hydra then reforms to eight Orochi clones and later a final Orochi X form. While battling them, the coalition also have to gain the trust of Susanoo, who is not yet willing to let the problem fall into the mortal's hands. The game has three endings, which are unlocked through certain requirements. The ""Normal"" ending has the coalition finally being able to destroy Hydra. The ""Good"" ending is essentially the same, although the warriors then make pledge to rule the land together in peace. In the ""True"" ending, after Orochi X is defeated, the dimensional world begins to crumble, as Orochi's existence is the only thing that supports the world; defeating him means the end of the world. The mystics band their powers to send the warriors back to their own original time, saving them at the cost of their memories in the dimensional world.  The expanded story in the Ultimate update is continued from the ""Good"" ending of the original game, thus forgoing the ""True"" ending. Da Ji and the rest of the Demon Army have broken out from the coalition and are now traversing the dimensional world. They are attracted to a magical stone they found during their journey, which is revealed to be the sealed form of Mae Tamamo, a mystic who possesses a mysterious mirror, the Shinkyō, which has the ability to seal anyone who comes into contact with it and to create doppelgangers. Allying herself with Da Ji, Tamamo seals many warriors of the Three Kingdoms and Sengoku period and create doppelgangers of them, causing chaos and conflict within the Coalition. The mystics, who have gone to the mystic realm since the Hydra's defeat, descend once more to help the warriors. Depending on the progression, the player may finish the game's story in Chapter 6, which ends in the release of the sealed warriors and Tamamo's defeat and subsequent sealing as the stone again by the mystics. Otherwise, while the sealed warriors are released, Tamamo is not yet defeated, and the story continues to Chapter 7.  In an attempt to stop Tamamo from causing further conflicts, the warriors will need her own magic mirror, the Shinkyō to seal her. Through Kaguya's powers combined with Fu Xi's memories, the warriors travel far back in time in the mystic realm, when Orochi had not existed yet. The mystic realm is ruled by Tiandi, who is the original possessor of the Shinkyō and had used it to seal demons. The warriors meet with the mystic Yinglong, who is fooled by Tamamo into believing that the Emperor had used the Shinkyō to control the demons. He starts a rebellion against the Emperor and eventually manages to steal the mirror, This act causes him to be corrupted by the mirror's evil power, which transforms him into Orochi, who proceeds to go to the human realm to commit various evil acts after having killed the half-mystic Nezha. The Emperor, having learned of Tamamo's plans, gratefully lends the warriors the Shinkyō. Back in the present time, the warriors use the mirror against Tamamo, but this only makes her revert to her true form, the Kyūbi no Kitsune, who confronts the warriors in the final battle. The Ultimate update has two endings in addition to the three mentioned above, the first of which is the aforementioned ""Normal"" ending where Tamamo is sealed without having reverted to her true form. In this ending the warriors continue to live their life in peace in the dimensional world. The second ending is similar to the ""True"" ending of the original game, where, after having sealed Kyūbi, the mystics band their powers to send the warriors to their original timeline; however, the dimensional world seems to stay intact, unlike the original game.

1196,Warriors Orochi 4 Ultimate,/wiki/Warriors_Orochi_4_Ultimate,Hack and slash,Omega Force,Koei Tecmo,"December 19, 2019","February 14, 2020","February 14, 2020"," As with the previous iterations, the player is given control of a three-man team consisting of characters from the Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors series. Each character has a class type that determines their ability: Power, Speed, and Technique; the Wonder type introduced in Warriors Orochi 3 has been removed. New to the series is the concept of magic and Sacred Treasures, techniques that allow characters to perform special feats to overcome enemies. These depend on a specific category that is separate from the class system, and are performed by holding down the right shoulder button and pressing either the normal, charge, or musou attack buttons, the latter two requiring a special magic gauge, and the last also requiring half of a player's musou gauge. As such, these replace the type actions from the previous games. Because of this, characters from the Dynasty Warriors series lack their second musou attack, but retain the ability to perform an aerial musou attack, and characters from the Samurai Warriors series lack their special attacks, but retain the ability to perform hyper attacks.  The ability to mount a horse remains in Warriors Orochi 4, and is performed by holding down the right shoulder button and pressing the jump button.  The Awakening mechanic from Dynasty Warriors 8 and Musou Gokui mechanic from Samurai Warriors 4 are unified in Warriors Orochi 4, and may only be activated by obtaining a rare powerup during gameplay and pressing the left analog stick; when playing with only a single Joy-Con on the Nintendo Switch, this is instead activated by pressing both SL and SR, as the left analog stick alone is normally mapped to the character switch functionality. Only one character from a team may use this at a given time, though the character activating it need not be the character that obtained the powerup, and players may still switch characters while the mode is active. Once activated, the character may perform their Rage attack, consistent with both Dynasty Warriors 8 and Samurai Warriors 4.  Characters central to the story are, once the relevant portions of the story are cleared, be given a ""deification"" form based on figures from Greek or Norse mythology, which will be in effect while Awakening or Musou Gokui is in effect, strengthening their various other actions in the process.  As with previous games, most stages in Warriors Orochi 4 are taken from either earlier installments of the Warriors Orochi series, or the Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors source games, with a minimal amount of original stages, reskinned to suit the theme of Warriors Orochi 4.  However, new to this game are mashup stages where one part of a stage is taken from Dynasty Warriors and another part is taken from Samurai Warriors; for example, the Baidi Castle stage from Dynasty Warriors 8 has the upper portion taken from the Oshi Castle stage from Samurai Warriors 4.  The game features several multiplayer options, including a three-versus-three competitive multiplayer mode.   Following the events of Warriors Orochi 3, the heroes of the Three Kingdoms and Sengoku period return to their time, having forgotten all their exploits in the dimensional world. However, Zeus, the king of Olympus, decides to bring them back for an unclear purpose. His son, Perseus, weary of Zeus' constant meddling of mortal affairs, decides to steal his eight Ouroboros bracelets, made from the hair of Medusa and containing a godly power, and contact the mortals, only to end up causing them to be scattered across the world.   Subsequently, the heroes are divided into four factions, each with a bracelet wielder. Perseus leads the first one, which includes Naotora Ii, Guan Yinping, and Yukimura Sanada, each controlling the power of Aphrodite, Freya, and Tyr, respectively. The second is led by the Mystic Nuwa and includes Nobunaga Oda, who controls the power of Izanagi. The third is led by Zeus' children, Ares and Athena, and includes Zhao Yun, Mitsunari Ishida, and Cao Pi, each controlling the power of Apollo, Hermes, and Poseidon, respectively. The final faction includes Da Ji and Lu Bu, who wields the power of Thor. The first two factions link up, as Nobunaga and Nuwa had only wanted to test the mantle of their adversary. Yukimura forms a bond with Perseus, while Ares is revealed to have earned the loyalty of Cao Pi and Hideyoshi Toyotomi, whom he mistakenly thinks is a bracelet wielder, by promising them worldly power, but they realize that he has no intention of keeping it.  Perseus eventually unmasks himself as Loki, a servant of Odin, the king of Asgard, who secretly leads Da Ji's faction. He deliberately scattered the bracelets so the heroes could channel their godly power, therefore stabilizing the world enough for Odin to enact his plan: summoning the God of Destruction, the world's will taking the form of Orochi, so he can grow Yggdrasil and create a weapon powerful enough to destroy the universe and start it with a clean slate. Odin offers Ares, frustrated by Zeus' inaction, a chance to depose his father. When the heroes finally defeat Zeus, who admits that he only wanted to spar with them, Ares snaps and kills him, absorbing his power and declaring himself the new king of Olympus.  A distraught Athena joins the heroes to prevent Odin from completing his plan. After a series of battles, Odin becomes impatient of Ares' failure to contain the coalition and steals Zeus' power from him. To atone for his actions, Ares chooses to sacrifice a part of his life force to resurrect his father. Meanwhile, the God of Destruction's arrival unexpectedly resurrects the real Orochi, who assists the heroes to kill him before being killed himself. However, the heroes are too late to stop Odin from growing Yggdrasil. At the last minute, Loki turns on Odin and causes Yggdrasil to weaken, having had a change of heart and wanting to avenge his fallen friends, who were killed by Odin during Ragnarok. An enraged Odin kills Loki, only to perish at the hands of the heroes.   The victory is shortlived, however, as the toll of Orochi's and the God of Destruction's deaths have split apart the balance of the world. The Olympians and the Mystics band together to send the heroes back to their time. The heroes once again lose the memories of their exploits, though they retain a sense that there are beings watching them from above.  "

Players control Geralt of Rivia, a monster slayer known as a Witcher. Geralt walks, runs, rolls and dodges, and (for the first time in the series) jumps, climbs and swims. He has a variety of weapons, including bombs, a crossbow and two swords (one steel and one silver). The steel sword is used primarily to kill humans while the silver sword is more effective against creatures and monsters. Players can draw out, switch and sheathe their swords at will. There are two modes of melee attack; light attacks are fast but weak, and heavy attacks are slow but strong. Players can block and counter enemy attacks with their swords. Swords have limited endurance and require regular repair. In addition to physical attacks, Geralt has five magical signs at his disposal: Aard, Axii, Igni, Yrden and Quen. Aard prompts Geralt to unleash a telekinetic blast, Axii confuses enemies, Igni burns them, Yrden slows them down and Quen offers players a temporary, protective shield. The signs use stamina, and cannot be used indefinitely. Players can use mutagens to increase Geralt's magic power. They lose health when attacked by enemies, although wearing armour can help reduce health loss. Health is restored with meditation or consumables, such as food and potions. Players occasionally control Ciri, Geralt's adoptive daughter who can teleport short distances. The game has responsive, advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and dynamic environments. The day-night cycle influences some monsters; a werewolf becomes powerful during the night of a full moon. Players can learn about their enemies and prepare for combat by reading the in-game bestiary. When they kill an enemy, they can loot its corpse for valuables. Geralt's witcher sense enables players to find objects of interest, including items that can be collected or scavenged. Items are stored in the inventory, which can be expanded by purchasing upgrades. Players can sell items to vendors or use them to craft potions and bombs. They can visit blacksmiths to craft new weapons and armour with what they have gathered. The price of an item and the cost of crafting it depend on a region's local economy.  The game focuses on narrative, and has a dialogue wheel which allows players to choose how to respond to non-player characters. Geralt must make decisions which change the state of the world and lead to 36 possible endings, affecting the lives of in-game characters. He can have a romantic relationship with some of the game's female characters by completing certain quests. In addition to the main quests, books offer more information on the game's world. Players can begin side quests after visiting a town's noticeboard. These side missions include Witcher Contracts (elaborate missions requiring players to hunt monsters) and Treasure Hunt quests, which reward players with top-tier weapons or armour. Players earn experience points by completing missions. When a player earns enough experience, Geralt's level increases and the player receives ability points. These points may be used on four skill trees: combat, signs, alchemy and general. Combat upgrades enhance Geralt's attacks and unlock new fighting techniques; signs upgrades enable him to use magic more efficiently, and alchemy upgrades improve crafting abilities. General upgrades have a variety of functions, from raising Geralt's vitality to increasing crossbow damage. The game's open world is divided into several regions. Geralt can explore each region on foot or by transportation, such as a boat. Roach, his horse, may be summoned at will. Players can kill enemies with their sword while riding Roach, but an enemy presence may frighten the horse and unseat Geralt. Points of interest may be found on the map, and players receive experience points after completing mini-missions in these regions. Players can discover Places of Power for additional ability points. Other activities include horse racing, boxing and card playing; the card-playing mechanic was later expanded into a standalone game.  "

In battle, players control a party of Mirages which can be stacked upon each other to grant various boons in battle while decreasing the number of turns that can be taken. The types of Mirages used affect the party's available skills and abilities in battle. Mirages are befriended in battle after they have been sufficiently weakened, and once in the party can be freely named. In addition to standard Mirages are special Mirages that can be temporarily summoned into battle using Action Points (AP): the Mirage remains in battle, replacing the main party, until the summoner's AP is depleted.

Initially, pipes appear throughout the land, waking up many sleeping Goo Balls who have gone undisturbed until this, as they are filled with a childlike sense of curiosity and naivety they build themselves towards the pipes. Upon reaching the pipe entrance, the Goo Balls are sucked by the pipe system into the ""World of Goo Corporation"" main building where they are processed into many products, for example an energy drink. The excess Goo Balls are left outside the Corporation headquarters where they together begin to build a giant tower. At the end of the first chapter, some Goo Balls escape from a Corporation building by attaching themselves to eyeballs which have the ability to fly. The chapter ends with the Goo Balls ""seeing far away new lands"".  In the second chapter, more pipes appear in a hostile wasteland where World of Goo Corporation turns out to be searching for a new power source due to wind power not being sufficient anymore. However, the location and appearance of the power source was forgotten, because in the past, it stopped producing electricity. A new Goo Ball is introduced, which is ground up by the Corporation into a facial cream. Near the end of the chapter, the power plant, which looks like a giant woman, is discovered. It is revealed that for many years, its remarkably powerful ""beauty juice"" powered the world. Yet with age, her beauty and consequently her electric output began to die. However, unrefined beauty goo was injected directly into her forehead, as to restore her youthful beauty once more. At the expense of her ability to move her face, power was restored to the entire world. With this newfound energy, the World of Goo Corporation was able to open a factory, aiming to complete their most compelling new product.  During the third chapter it is said that the Corporation is developing a mysterious ""Product Z."" It eventually turns out that the mysterious Product Z is actually the third dimension (Product Z is the Z axis in mathematics). This causes much commotion amongst the general population who cannot see where anything is now. World of Goo Corporation tells them to contact tech support in the information superhighway after mankind, all animal and plant life becomes rendered ""incompatible with the world"".  In the fourth chapter the Goo Balls set out to find the mysterious ""MOM"" program amongst a vector style environment. Shortly after the beginning the Goo Balls find the object responsible for rendering all the graphics. After pumping many of their own kind into the object, the graphics rendering improves, creating a more realistic environment (and the Pixel Goo Balls). Near the end they encounter MOM's computer, who turns out to be a spam bot, and supplies the Goo Balls with an ""undelete"" program. The Goo Balls try to overload Product Z by sending every message in the history of spam to everyone at the World of Goo Corporation. After venturing to the Recycle Bin and un-deleting everything, World of Goo Corporation receives the mail and, unable to deal with so much spam and mail, explodes, shutting down Product Z while creating a massive layer of smog, dust, smoke and debris that envelops the entire world.  In the final chapter, it is revealed that all Goo Balls, except ""scientifically pure"" ones, have been sucked away to the ""Tower of Goo Memorial Park and Recreation Center"". The remaining Goo Balls decide to work their way up the world's tallest island to reach a site where the telescope is located. The final level of the game reveals that the Goo Balls are now completely extinct, all the remaining having been sucked away to the shattered remains of the World of Goo Corporation and added to the tower, and the gigantic telescope at the site has been rendered useless as it cannot see past the layer of smog. The Sign Painter reveals that in his final sign he has now become the Telescope Operator. Some balloon-like fish in the sea connect to the telescope and lift it out of the ground, where it breaks through the layer of smog and sees the tower of goo that has been built at the former World of Goo Corporation Headquarters, which can also see past the smog. The telescope falls back to earth before it could see what the Goo Balls were building towards. A final and last cutscene reveals their goal; the camera pans up into space to reveal that the Goo Balls that escaped at the end of Chapter 1 have managed to reach a far-off planet populated entirely by Goo Balls.  An additional chapter, located on the Moon, was initially planned for the European retail version of the game.

The biggest change to gameplay mechanics comes from Blades, sentient beings summoned from ""Core Crystals"" who provide their summoners - called Drivers - weapons in combat and make up the player's party (separate from the character party). Each character can only have three Blades active at a time. The Blade equipped on a Driver determines their class, and Blade weapon types are divided into three main categories: Attacker, Healer, and Tank. Blades support their Driver in the form of buffs and special attacks performed by both a Driver and their Blade. Buffs and other upgrades can be unlocked through a Blade's Affinity Chart. A Blade is tied to their Driver, and cannot usually be used by another; however, a rare item called the Overdrive Protocol allows the player to change a Blade's affiliated Driver.  There are a total of 40 distinctly unique ""rare"" blades to collect throughout the base game with an additional 11 being obtainable either through DLC packs or New Game Plus in later patches. Each Driver has a Blade automatically assigned to them when they join the party, who are also a part of the game's story. Most of the game's Blades are not a part of the main story, and can be assigned to any Driver; among those is KOS-MOS from the Xeno sub-series Xenosaga.  "

The game centers on the main character, named XIII, who has awakened with amnesia. He uses a variety of weapons and gadgets to uncover the mystery of his identity throughout the 13 chapters and 34 missions. The characters and weaponry in XIII are cel-shaded, giving a deliberately comic book style appearance, including onomatopoeic words contained in bubbles for sound effects. It uses Unreal Engine 2 because it was ""really strong for level design"" and allowed development ""across all platforms using one engine"". The graphics were compared with Jet Set Radio Future and Auto Modellista. The developer felt that the appearance reflected the comic book and innovated in its portrayal of violence; blood splatters are shown in a cartoon manner.  XIII includes 16 weapons, from a knife to a bazooka, an Uzi to an M60. Objects such as bottles, chairs, or brooms may be used as weapons. Kevlar gear, helmets and first aid boxes are scattered throughout the map. People can be taken as hostages or as human shields, preventing enemies from firing on the protagonist. Lock picks are used to unlock doors and grapnels to climb on walls. Through the ""sixth sense"", XIII can hear enemies behind walls with the aid of ""tap-tap-tap"" signals. Stealth operations include strangling enemies or hiding dead bodies. Comic strip-style insets pop up at the top when a headshot is performed or serve as clues or tips for the player.   "

The differences are aesthetic only.  During a bug-collecting assignment assigned to students by a school in suburban Springdale, Nate Adams is jealous of classmate Barnaby ""Bear"" Berenstein's large stag beetle he caught, and decides to find another bug to rival him. Upon being prompted by the school's janitor to visit Mount Wildwood, Nate discovers an unusual capsule machine. He decides to take a capsule from it, and upon opening the capsule, frees a strange ghostly being. The being introduces himself as Whisper, and states that he is what is known as a Yo-kai. He gives Nate the Yo-kai Watch, a device used to find Yo-kai, and prompts Nate to use it. After Nate befriends two additional Yo-kai, Whisper further explains that Yo-kai are as abundant as humans; the only reason Nate could not comprehend them before being that they blend into their surroundings.  Nate returns home with Whisper in tow, only to find that Nate's parents, Lily and Aaron Adams, are bickering over whether Aaron should fix dinner, and find that Dismeralda is the cause. She refuses to leave, but Nate and Whisper head to an intersection and find Jibanyan, who immediately joins them to fight Dismeralda. She is defeated, but her husband, Happiere, calls off the battle and makes up with Dismeralda. He also inspirits Lily and Aaron to allow them to make up, thus ending the conflict.  The following day, Nate visits Katie to find her upset over the fact that she said things she never intended to say to her friend, causing the latter to shut down. Realizing that a Yo-kai is responsible, Nate finds Tattletell, and after befriending her, asks her to inspirit Katie once more to allow her to reconcile with her friend. With the issue resolved, Tattletell reveals why she inspirited Katie in the first place: a group of evil Yo-kai led by Slimamander had broken many seals, thus disrupting the link between the human and Yo-kai realms. With the help of the other Yo-kai thus far, Nate and Whisper defeat all of the evil Yo-kai and roll back the damage caused to the seals.  Realizing how tough Slimamander was, Nate and Whisper decide to head to Timers and More, where the shopkeeper, a human-mimicking Yo-kai named Mr. Goodsight, agrees to upgrade Nate's Yo-kai Watch rank, but assigns him two specific tasks to complete beforehand. Nate befriends Baku while completing the first task, who proves the key in commencing out the second task: retrieving Mr. Goodsight's undergarment from the local spa at night. After narrowly evading an Oni attack along the way, they discover that Sproink has stolen the undergarment as a clothing item for himself. A battle ensues, and Nate emerges victorious, thus allowing him to return the undergarments to Mr. Goodsight to complete the watch upgrade.  The next day, after Bear uses his mother's ring to catch the ""king of Catfish Pond"" and inadvertently loses it, Mr. Bernstein berates his son and instructs him to retrieve it. Nate finds out about the ordeal, and he and Whisper decide to head to a riverside to find a kappa Yo-kai named Walkappa. They head to the lake and find the ring, only to disrupt another Yo-kai named SV Snaggerjag. After the ensuing battle, SV Snaggerjag reveals that he is the king of Catfish Pond, and he warned that the group was scaring off the catfish in the area. The ring is returned to Bear's mother, who reveals that it was not as valuable as was initially believed, relieving Nate, Whisper, Bear, and Walkappa.  The following morning, Aaron Adams, on his way to work, accidentally leaves behind important documents at Sunshine Station thanks to a Yo-kai named Wazzat. Lily Adams is contacted and asks her son to head to the office so that he can return the documents. Nate and Whisper retrieve the documents and board the train with little trouble; however, they are soon ambushed by Wazzat. The two evade Wazzat long enough to return the documents; on the way back, Wazzat reveals that he was lonely and offers to join Nate, of whom the latter accepts.  As thanks for saving his father's job, Nate is given a bike. He rides around Flower Road, only to hear rumors about development in the area. He comes across a Yo-kai named Kyubi, who blackmails him into entering the construction zone at night. Nate and Whisper do so, meeting Komasan along the way. However, they find that Kyubi had been leading them to the real culprit all along: a Yo-kai known as Massiface. Nate and his Yo-kai team manage to defeat Massiface after a long battle, and the rumors stop.  Nate then visits Eddie, and the two visit an art museum with Eddie's parents. Though they enjoy the museum, Eddie is distraught that he did not find the exhibit he was looking for. He asks Nate to accompany him in sneaking to the museum at night, which Nate agrees to. After being warped into the museum by a Yo-kai named Mirapo and evading the museum's security protocols, Nate is forced to battle Phantasmurai, a suit of armor that Eddie was trying to observe. Eddie is ridiculed that the suit is controlled by a mouse, but gets over it as he and Nate exit the museum.  All of Nate's friends meet up with him at the school to attempt to find a mysterious Yo-kai that had been causing mischief within the school. The Yo-kai abducts all of Nate's friends, and Nate and Whisper are forced to find them, but not before facing the mischievous Yo-kai, revealed to be Tarantutor. After a long battle, Nate is victorious, and joins his friends for a brief fireworks celebration.  Whisper, however, becomes suspicious and asks Nate to return to the school to search for more clues. After being directed by Mr. Barton to the abandoned Nocturne Hospital, they find that the building has unusual Yo-kai activity. The source is eventually confirmed to be the evil Doctor Maddiman, of whom Nate is forced to battle. Maddiman is defeated, but not before revealing that he works for Squddilius McCracken, a dissident Yo-kai planning to take over the Yo-kai realm and destroy the human realm.  Nate and Whisper are uneasy, but are given hope when a classmate of Nate's, Lucas, reveals that he is a Yo-kai himself, having been born from Enma, the true ruler of the Yo-kai realm. Nate and Whisper venture to the Yo-kai realm to seek answers. They encounter McCracken and seemingly defeat him. However, when they return to the human realm, they find that all of the seals are broken once more, McCracken has deployed his minions in the area, and Slimamander is once again awakened.  Nate and the others manage to defeat all of McCracken's lackeys and restore the seals, but McCracken, refusing to give up, transforms into a giant beast. After a hard battle, Nate and his Yo-kai team defeat McCracken and banish him from the human realm for good. Whisper, knowing that more evil Yo-kai will attack the human realm, decides to close the elevator linking the two realms together; Nate, finally accepting their fate, reluctantly accepts, and all of the Yo-kai forcibly return to their realm, leaving Nate behind. Nate returns to his house as the credits roll, drawing a picture of his Yo-kai friends to remember them.  In a post-credits scene, Nate notices Jibanyan on the edge of his house the following day. To his amazement, all of his Yo-kai friends have restored the elevator, thus able to return to the human realm once more.   Yo-kai Watch is a role-playing video game where the player searches around Springdale for Yo-kai using the 3DS' touchscreen. Players befriend Yo-kai by giving them a food that they like before beginning battle, and after defeating the Yo-kai it approaches the player character and gives them its Yo-kai Medal, allowing it to be summoned at will. Yo-kai can also be acquired through an in game Gasha Machine by collecting in-game coins or using Play Coins. Certain Yo-kai are necessary for completing the game's main quest, and special rare Yo-kai are acquired through various subquests. Yo-kai have the capability to evolve into more powerful versions of themselves if they reach a certain level, or they can evolve by combining with particular items or other Yo-kai. The Yo-kai are divided amongst eight different tribes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. There are also Legendary Yo-kai that can only be obtained by collecting a particular set of Yo-kai listed in the Yo-kai Medallium, a compendium of the different Yo-kai the player has encountered or befriended.  When the player encounters a Yo-kai, they enter into battle with it using six Yo-kai that the player has befriended previously. The touchscreen is used during battles to rotate amongst the player's Yo-kai in battle at will. It is also used either to clear up status effects on the player's Yo-kai or to charge up the Yo-kai's special abilities. A common in-game event is ""Oni Time"" (Terror Time), where the player character enters a nightmare realm where he or she looks for treasure chests with special items in them all while trying to avoid being seen by other Yo-kai. If spotted, the player is chased by a powerful Oni Yo-kai that can easily wipe out the player's party unless they can escape. It is possible to defeat the Oni, but only if the player's Yo-kai are particularly powerful. The player can also encounter similarly powerful Namahage Yo-kai if the player crosses the street on a red light, but the encounter may be beneficial if the player follows the rules.  "

The game is set in an alternate version of World War II, as such the player character utilizes appropriate weapons for that era. Again like V2, the player can utilise various types of explosives, including standard grenades, tripwire mines and dynamite. Another mechanic returning from V2 is that, when using the sniper rifle, certain elements such as wind direction and strength and bullet drop can affect the path of the bullet when it is fired. Bullets can ricochet off surfaces or targets and strike others. The player can also hold their breath to steady their shot and more precisely determine the direction their bullet will travel in.  The ""X-Ray Kill Cam"" feature from V2 also makes a return, in which when a successful and skilled shot is made, the camera will track the bullet from the sniper rifle to the target in slow motion, and upon impact will show an anatomically correct x-ray style reveal of the body part being hit and the damage the bullet causes to the organs and bones. Some items can also trigger an explosion when shot, which can be used to the player's advantage against the hordes of zombies. The game will also measure notable shots by briefly displaying distance and other factors like whether it was a head shot or moving target.   In April 1945, German dictator Adolf Hitler, who is hiding in the Führerbunker is informed by a Wehrmacht officer that the war is lost and Berlin will soon fall, leaving surrender as their only option. Enraged, Hitler executes the officer and declares that the Fatherland will not fall.  He then orders the execution of ""Plan Z""-the resurrection of all the Wehrmacht's fallen soldiers as zombies.  Once the zombies are released, OSS operative and sniper Karl Fairburne, veteran Red Army infantryman Boris Medvedev, Wehrmacht Captain Hermann Wolff, and German occultist Efram Schwaiger are forced to team up in an abandoned village not far from Berlin.  After clearing the village of zombies, the quartet commandeers a truck to take them to Berlin. Once there, they find the city in chaos; zombies roam the streets and alleyways. A radio transmission tells the quartet that the zombies are gathering in the nearby Memorial Cathedral, so the four go to investigate. At the cathedral, they find an SS occult general summoning zombies. In a fight with him and his minions, the survivors send the demonically-possessed officer back to Hell and discover a tunnel under the church's altar. The tunnel leads the group to an underground facility overrun with the undead. Inside, the four discover a reference to a Book of Souls, stored in the Berlin Central Library, which is a safeguard medieval occult text in case the zombies proved difficult to control. Hitler never retrieved it before unleashing the horde. Exiting the facility, the survivors fight their way to the library, where they obtain the book and unleash its power on the zombies, but find that its effects are negligible. The four then escape through the U-Bahn to a canal where they kill another SS occult general and escape via a British agent on a boat.  Meanwhile, in his underground bunker, Hitler and his last general (Hitler having killed the other two) discuss the Sagarmatha Relic, an artifact intended to protect Hitler from the undead soldiers. The general reveals that Hitler needed all three pieces in order for it to work, whereupon Hitler beats the officer to death with the Relic fragment. The zombies then storm the Führerbunker and kill Hitler. Faireburne and the survivors are led back to Berlin when Allied intelligence reports the Sagarmatha Relic and its purpose to them, so they arrive at the Brandenburg Gate to retrieve the first piece of the Relic from the Kaiser-Friederich-Museum, killing zombies along the way. Once retrieved, the four proceed to the Berlin Planetarium, where they discover a secret entrance to Hitler's bunker. After clearing the bunker, the four retrieve the second piece from Hitler's office. Schwaiger directs them to a G-Tower outside Berlin. The four seize a train from a nearby railyard and make their way there. En route, they are informed by their British intelligence contact that the Allies have authorized Operation Red Harvest-a plan to carpet bomb Berlin and the surrounding area with atomic bombs to hopefully destroy the zombies. Racing against time, the four successfully penetrate the tower, defeat the occult general atop it, and retrieve the third piece of the Relic. The four are spirited away as the USAAF bombs the area.  Three months later, in August, Hitler has risen from the dead and joined the ranks of the undead as their leader. Still humanly sentient, Hitler has organized the zombies into Germany's new army, using them to tighten his grip on the Third Reich. Pockets of survivors have sprung up all over Germany, supported by Allied airdrops of supplies. Faireburne, Wolff, Medvedev, and Schwaiger are tasked with retrieving war-winning intel from a British agent named MacNeil who they discover was killed by the zombies after being forced into St. Ulrich Hospital. When they do, they discover that Hitler has obtained the Book of Souls and is shipping his undead troops to an unknown location. The four hitch a ride on one of Hitler's supply trains and take it straight to a rally where Hitler is outlining his plans for the new Undead Reich. Faireburne attempts to assassinate Hitler, only for the bullet to stop right in front of Hitler's face. Only Schwaiger's use of the Relic prevents the four from being swarmed by the zombies at the rally. The squad is then deployed to infiltrate the Folterschloss, Hitler's private mountain stronghold in a forest nearby. Making their way to the tram station that supports the castle, the four discover that Hitler is attempting to use humans to power a propaganda device in the castle. The four find the key that activates the full power of the Relic and escape as the man powering the device detonates the fortification. Hitler's headquarters is determined to be a large fortified facility inside the irradiated badlands outside Berlin, which the group infiltrates. They sabotage the industrial plant that the Führer is using to manufacture weapons, equipment, and food supplies for the zombie army and then face off with Hitler himself. After defeating an enormous zombie Hitler, Faireburne tosses the real Hitler down to Hell.  Medvedev throws the relic, and Faireburne shoots it just before it enters the Hellhole, releasing its holy energy. The quartet manage to escape as Hitler's headquarters is completely destroyed.  "
